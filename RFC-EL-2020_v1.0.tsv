760	Version	The Version field indicates the format of the internet header . This document describes version 4 . 	220	0
760	IHL	Internet Header Length is the length of the internet header in 32 bit words , and thus points to the beginning of the data . Note that the minimum value for a correct header is 5 . 	100	0
760	Type of Service	The Type of Service provides an indication of the abstract parameters of the quality of service desired . These parameters are to be used to guide the selection of the actual service parameters when transmitting a datagram through a particular network . Several networks offer service precedence , which somehow treats high precedence traffic as more important than other traffic . A few networks offer a Stream service , whereby one can achieve a smoother service at some cost . Typically this involves the reservation of resources within the network . Another choice involves a low-delay vs . high-reliability trade off . Typically networks invoke more complex ( and delay producing ) mechanisms as the need for reliability increases . 	240	0
760	Total Length	Total Length is the length of the datagram , measured in octets , including internet header and data . This field allows the length of a datagram to be up to 65,535 octets . Such long datagrams are impractical for most hosts and networks . All hosts must be prepared to accept datagrams of up to 576 octets ( whether they arrive whole 	100	0
760	Identification	An identifying value assigned by the sender to aid in assembling the fragments of a datagram . 	400	0
760	Flags	Flags : 3 bits 	231	0
760	Fragment Offset	This field indicates where in the datagram this fragment belongs . The fragment offset is measured in units of 8 octets ( 64 bits ). The first fragment has offset zero . 	110	0
760	Time to Live	This field indicates the maximum time the datagram is allowed to remain the internet system . If this field contains the value zero , then the datagram should be destroyed . This field is modified in internet header processing . The time is measured in units of seconds . The intention is to cause undeliverable datagrams to be discarded . 	122	0
760	Protocol	This field indicates the next level protocol used in the data portion of the internet datagram . The values for various protocols are specified in reference [ 6 ]. 	231	0

760	Options	The option field is variable in length . There may be zero or more options . There are two cases for the format of an option : 	400	0
760	Version	Version : Same as the datagram in error . IHL : As computed . Type of Service : Zero . Total Length : As computed . Identification : A new identification is selected . Flags : Zero . Fragment Offset : Zero . Time to Live : Sixty . Protocol : Same as the datagram in error . Header Checksum : As computed . Source Address : Address of the error reporting module . Destination Address : Source address of the datagram in error . Options : The General Error Report Option . Padding : As needed . 	110	0
760	Padding	The internet header padding is used to ensure that the internet header ends on a 32 bit boundary . The padding is zero . 	302	0
760	Identification	The choice of the Identifier for a datagram is based on the need to provide a way to uniquely identify the fragments of a particular datagram . The protocol module assembling fragments judges fragments to belong to the same datagram if they have the same source , destination , protocol , and Identifier . Thus , the sender must choose the Identifier to be unique for this source , destination pair and protocol for the time the datagram ( or any fragment of it ) could be alive in the internet . 	231	0
760	Type of Service	The type of service ( TOS ) is for internet service quality selection . The type of service is specified along the abstract parameters precedence , reliability , and speed . A further concern is the possibility of efficient handling of streams of datagrams . These abstract parameters are to be mapped into the actual service parameters of the particular networks the datagram traverses . 	231	0
760	Time to Live	The time to live is set by the sender to the maximum time the datagram is allowed to be in the internet system . If the datagram is in the internet system longer than the time to live , then the datagram should be destroyed . This field should be decreased at each point that the internet header is processed to reflect the time spent processing the datagram . Even if no local information is available on the time actually spent , the field should be decremented by 1 . The time is measured in units of seconds ( i.e . the value 1 means one second ). Thus , the maximum time to live is 255 seconds or 4.25 minutes . 	122	0
760	Options	The options are just that , optional . That is , the presence or absence of an option is the choice of the sender , but each internet module must be able to parse every option . There can be several options present in the option field . 	400	0

761	Window	The number of data octets beginning with the one indicated in the acknowledgment field which the sender of this segment is willing to accept . 	110	0
761	Checksum	The checksum field is the 16 bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of all 16 bit words in the header and text . If a segment contains an odd number of header and text octets to be checksummed , the last octet is padded on the right with zeros to form a 16 bit word for checksum purposes . The pad is not transmitted as part of the segment . While computing the checksum , the checksum field itself is replaced with zeros . 	301	0
761	Urgent Pointer	This field communicates the current value of the urgent pointer as a positive offset from the sequence number in this segment . The urgent pointer points to the sequence number of the octet following the urgent data . This field should only be interpreted in segments with the URG control bit set . 	110	0
761	Options	Options may occupy space at the end of the TCP header and are a multiple of 8 bits in length . All options are included in the checksum . An option may begin on any octet boundary . There are two cases for the format of an option : 	110	0

791	Type of Service	The Type of Service provides an indication of the abstract parameters of the quality of service desired . These parameters are to be used to guide the selection of the actual service parameters when transmitting a datagram through a particular network . Several networks offer service precedence , which somehow treats high precedence traffic as more important than other traffic ( generally by accepting only traffic above a certain precedence at time of high load ). The major choice is a three way tradeoff between low-delay , high-reliability , and high-throughput . 	240	0
791	Total Length	Total Length is the length of the datagram , measured in octets , including internet header and data . This field allows the length of a datagram to be up to 65,535 octets . Such long datagrams are impractical for most hosts and networks . All hosts must be prepared to accept datagrams of up to 576 octets ( whether they arrive whole or in fragments ). It is recommended that hosts only send datagrams larger than 576 octets if they have assurance that the destination is prepared to accept the larger datagrams . 	100	0

791	Time to Live	This field indicates the maximum time the datagram is allowed to remain in the internet system . If this field contains the value zero , then the datagram must be destroyed . This field is modified in internet header processing . The time is measured in units of seconds , but since every module that processes a datagram must decrease the TTL by at least one even if it process the datagram in less than a second , the TTL must be thought of only as an upper bound on the time a datagram may exist . The intention is to cause undeliverable datagrams to be discarded , and to bound the maximum datagram lifetime . 	122	0
791	Protocol	This field indicates the next level protocol used in the data portion of the internet datagram . The values for various protocols are specified in " Assigned Numbers " [ 9 ]. 	231	0

Further , there is an extension of the LLC header called the Sub-Network Access Protocol ( SNAP ). 	231	0
1042	B	The Broadcast Indicators are used to indicate the routing desired for a particular frame . A frame may be routed through a single specified route , through every distinct non-repeating route in a multi-ring network , or through a single route determined by a spanning tree algorithm such that the frame appears on every ring exactly once . The values which may be used at this time are ( in binary ): 	200	0

It is analogous to a packet type field of the Ethernet , acting as a switch for higher-level protocols . The CoresidentEntity field , if used , designates a subgroup of the ServerEntityId group to which the Request should be routed , namely those members that are co-resident with the specified entity ( or entity group ). The primary intended use is to specify the manager for a particular service that is co-resident with a particular entity , using the well-known entity group identifier for the service manager in the ServerEntityId field and the identifier for the entity in the CoresidentEntity field . The next 12 octets are user - or application-specified . 	231	0

1045	MsgDelivery	MsgDelivery : 32 bits The segment blocks being transmitted ( in total ) in this packet group following the conventions for the PacketDelivery field . This field is ignored by the protocol and treated as an additional user data field if MDM is 0 .

On receipt , the MsgDelivery field is modified by the VMTP module to indicate the segment data blocks that were actually received before the message control block is passed to the user or RPC level . In particular , the kernel does not discard the packet group if segment data blocks are missing . A Server or Client entity receiving a message with a MsgDelivery in use must check the field to ensure adequate delivery and retry the operation if necessary . 	400	0
1045	SegmentSize	SegmentSize : 32 bits Size of segment in octets , up to a maximum of 16 kilooctets without streaming and 4 megaoctets with streaming , if SDA is set . Otherwise , this field is ignored by the protocol and treated as an additional user data field . 	200	0

More formally , if the token bucket size is B , and the token bucket rate is R , over any arbitrarily chosen interval T in the life of the flow , the amount of data that the flow sends cannot have exceeded B + ( R * T ) bytes . 	400	0
1363	Maximum Transmission Rate	The maximum transmission rate limits how fast packets may be sent back to back from the host . Consider that if the token bucket is full , it is possible for the flow to send a series of back-to-back packets equal to the size of the token bucket . If the token bucket size is large , this back-to-back run may be long enough to significantly inhibit multiplexing . 	400	0
1363	Minimum Delay Noticed	The minimum delay noticed field tells the internetwork that the host and application are effectively insensitive to improvements in end-to-end delay below this value .

1363	Maximum Delay Variation	If a receiving application requires data to be delivered in the same pattern that the data was transmitted , it may be necessary for the receiving host to briefly buffer data as it is received so that the receiver can restore the old transmission pattern . ( An easy example of this is a case where an application wishes to send and transmit data such as voice samples , which are generated and played at regular intervals . The regular intervals may be distorted by queueing effects in the network and the receiver may 	400	0
1363	Loss Sensitivity	This field indicates how sensitive the flow's traffic is to losses . Loss sensitivity can be expressed in one of two ways : either as a number of losses of MTU-sized packets in an interval , or simply as a value indicating a level of sensitivity . 	231	0

1374	W	W The Width bit , when set , requests a 64 bit connection through the switch . It is meaningless if Cable B is not installed at the Source . If W is set and either the Source or the requested Destination has no Cable B to the switch , the switch rejects the connection . Otherwise the switch connects both Cable A and Cable B if W is set , or Cable A only if W is clear .

1561	.	Like the TTL field of IP , this field indicates the maximum time the datagram is allowed to remain in the internet system . If this field contains the value zero , then the datagram MUST be destroyed; a host , however , MUST NOT send a datagram with a lifetime value of zero . This field is modified in internet header processing . The time is measured in units of 500 milliseconds , but since every module that processes a datagram MUST decrease the TTL by at least one even if it process the datagram in less than 500 millisecond , the TTL must be thought of only as an upper bound on the time a datagram may exist . The intention is to cause undeliverable datagrams to be discarded , and to bound the maximum CLNP datagram lifetime . [ Like IP , the colloquial usage of TTL in CLNP is as a coarse hop-count .] 	120	0

1561	.	A checksum is computed on the header only . It MUST be verified at each host/router that processes the packet; if header fields are changed during processing ( e.g ., the Lifetime ), the checksum is modified . If the checksum is not used , this field MUST be coded with a value of zero ( 0 ). See Appendix A for algorithms used in the computation and adjustment of the checksum . Readers are encouraged to see [ 10 ] for a description of an efficient implementation of the checksum algorithm . 	301	0

1561	.	Like the Fragment Offset of IP , this 16-bit is used to identify the relative octet position of the data in this fragment with respect to the start of the data submitted to CLNP; i.e ., it indicates where in the original datagram this fragment belongs . The offset is measured in octets; the value of this field shall always be a multiple of eight ( 8 ). This field is present when the fragmentation permitted flag is set to one . 	110	0
1561	.	The total length of the CLNP packet in octets is determined by the originator and placed in the Total Length field of the header . The Total Length field specifies the entire length of the original datagram , including both the header and data . This field MUST NOT be changed in any fragment of the original packet for the duration of the packet lifetime . This field is present when the fragmentation permitted flag is set to one . 	100	0

1889	SSRC	Synchronization source ( SSRC ): The source of a stream of RTP packets , identified by a 32-bit numeric SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header so as not to be dependent upon the network address . All packets from a synchronization source form part of the same timing and sequence number space , so a receiver groups packets by synchronization source for playback . Examples of synchronization sources include the sender of a stream of packets derived from a signal source such as a microphone or a camera , or an RTP mixer ( see below ). A synchronization source may change its data format , e.g ., audio encoding , over time . The SSRC identifier is a randomly chosen value meant to be globally unique within a particular RTP session ( see Section 8 ). A participant need not use the same SSRC identifier for all the RTP sessions in a multimedia session; the binding of the SSRC identifiers is provided through RTCP ( see Section 6.4.1 ). If a participant generates multiple streams in one RTP session , for example from separate video cameras , each must be identified as a different SSRC . 	230	0
1889	CSRC	Contributing source ( CSRC ): A source of a stream of RTP packets that has contributed to the combined stream produced by an RTP mixer ( see below ). The mixer inserts a list of the SSRC identifiers of the sources that contributed to the generation of a particular packet into the RTP header of that packet . This list is called the CSRC list . An example application is audio conferencing where a mixer indicates all the talkers whose speech was combined to produce the outgoing packet , allowing the receiver to indicate the current talker , even though all the audio packets contain the same SSRC identifier ( that of the mixer ). 	230	0
1889	V	version ( V ): 2 bits This field identifies the version of RTP . The version defined by this specification is two ( 2 ). ( The value 1 is used by the first draft version of RTP and the value 0 is used by the protocol initially implemented in the " vat " audio tool .) 	220	0

1889	X	extension ( X ): 1 bit If the extension bit is set , the fixed header is followed by exactly one header extension , with a format defined in Section 5.3.1 . 	210	0
1889	CC	CSRC count ( CC ): 4 bits The CSRC count contains the number of CSRC identifiers that follow the fixed header . 	231	0
1889	M	marker ( M ): 1 bit The interpretation of the marker is defined by a profile . It is intended to allow significant events such as frame boundaries to be marked in the packet stream . A profile may define additional marker bits or specify that there is no marker bit by changing the number of bits in the payload type field ( see Section 5.3 ). 	210	0
1889	PT	payload type ( PT ): 7 bits This field identifies the format of the RTP payload and determines its interpretation by the application . A profile specifies a default static mapping of payload type codes to payload formats . Additional payload type codes may be defined dynamically through non-RTP means ( see Section 3 ). An initial set of default mappings for audio and video is specified in the companion profile Internet-Draft draft-ietf-avt-profile , and may be extended in future editions of the Assigned Numbers RFC [ 6 ]. An RTP sender emits a single RTP payload type at any given time; this field is not intended for multiplexing separate media streams ( see Section 5.2 ). 	231	0
1889	sequence number	sequence number : 16 bits The sequence number increments by one for each RTP data packet sent , and may be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence . The initial value of the sequence number is random ( unpredictable ) to make known-plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult , even if the source itself does not encrypt , because the packets may flow through a translator that does . Techniques for choosing unpredictable numbers are discussed in [ 7 ]. 	200	0
1889	timestamp	timestamp : 32 bits The timestamp reflects the sampling instant of the first octet in the RTP data packet . The sampling instant must be derived 	121	0
1889	SSRC	SSRC : 32 bits The SSRC field identifies the synchronization source . This identifier is chosen randomly , with the intent that no two synchronization sources within the same RTP session will have the same SSRC identifier . An example algorithm for generating a random identifier is presented in Appendix A.6 . Although the probability of multiple sources choosing the same identifier is low , all RTP implementations must be prepared to detect and resolve collisions . Section 8 describes the probability of collision along with a mechanism for resolving collisions and detecting RTP-level forwarding loops based on the uniqueness of the SSRC identifier . If a source changes its source transport address , it must also choose a new SSRC identifier to avoid being interpreted as a looped source . 	230	0
1889	V	version ( V ): 2 bits Identifies the version of RTP , which is the same in RTCP packets as in RTP data packets . The version defined by this specification is two ( 2 ). 	220	0
1889	P	padding ( P ): 1 bit If the padding bit is set , this RTCP packet contains some additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the control information . The last octet of the padding is a count of how many padding octets should be ignored . Padding may be needed by some encryption algorithms with fixed block sizes . In a compound RTCP packet , padding should only be required on the last individual packet because the compound packet is encrypted as a whole . 	231	0
1889	RC	reception report count ( RC ): 5 bits The number of reception report blocks contained in this packet . A value of zero is valid . 	302	0
1889	PT	packet type ( PT ): 8 bits Contains the constant 200 to identify this as an RTCP SR packet . 	231	0
1889	length	length : 16 bits The length of this RTCP packet in 32-bit words minus one , including the header and any padding . ( The offset of one makes zero a valid length and avoids a possible infinite loop in scanning a compound RTCP packet , while counting 32-bit words avoids a validity check for a multiple of 4 .) 	100	0
1889	SSRC	SSRC : 32 bits The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this SR packet . 	230	0
1889	RTP timestamp	RTP timestamp : 32 bits Corresponds to the same time as the NTP timestamp ( above ), but in the same units and with the same random offset as the RTP timestamps in data packets . This correspondence may be used for intra - and inter-media synchronization for sources whose NTP timestamps are synchronized , and may be used by media - independent receivers to estimate the nominal RTP clock frequency . Note that in most cases this timestamp will not be equal to the RTP timestamp in any adjacent data packet . Rather , it is calculated from the corresponding NTP timestamp using the relationship between the RTP timestamp counter and real time as maintained by periodically checking the wallclock time at a sampling instant . 	122	0
1889	sender's packet count	sender's packet count : 32 bits The total number of RTP data packets transmitted by the sender since starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was generated . The count is reset if the sender changes its SSRC identifier . 	231	0
1889	sender's octet count	sender's octet count : 32 bits The total number of payload octets ( i.e ., not including header or padding ) transmitted in RTP data packets by the sender since starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was generated . The count is reset if the sender changes its SSRC identifier . This field can be used to estimate the average payload data rate . 	100	0
1889	fraction lost	fraction lost : 8 bits The fraction of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n lost since the previous SR or RR packet was sent , expressed as a fixed 	302	0
1889	cumulative number of packets lost	cumulative number of packets lost : 24 bits The total number of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n that have been lost since the beginning of reception . This number is defined to be the number of packets expected less the number of packets actually received , where the number of packets received includes any which are late or duplicates . Thus packets that arrive late are not counted as lost , and the loss may be negative if there are duplicates . The number of packets expected is defined to be the extended last sequence number received , as defined next , less the initial sequence number received . This may be calculated as shown in Appendix A.3 . 	200	0
1889	extended highest sequence number received	extended highest sequence number received : 32 bits The low 16 bits contain the highest sequence number received in an RTP data packet from source SSRC_n , and the most significant 16 bits extend that sequence number with the corresponding count of sequence number cycles , which may be maintained according to the algorithm in Appendix A.1 . Note that different receivers within the same session will generate different extensions to the sequence number if their start times differ significantly . 	200	0
1889	interarrival jitter	interarrival jitter : 32 bits An estimate of the statistical variance of the RTP data packet interarrival time , measured in timestamp units and expressed as an unsigned integer . The interarrival jitter J is defined to be the mean deviation ( smoothed absolute value ) of the difference D in packet spacing at the receiver compared to the sender for a pair of packets . As shown in the equation below , this is equivalent to the difference in the " relative transit time " for the two packets; the relative transit time is the difference between a packet's RTP timestamp and the receiver's clock at the time of arrival , measured in the same units . 	122	0

2138	Authenticator	The Authenticator field is sixteen ( 16 ) octets . The most significant octet is transmitted first . This value is used to authenticate the reply from the RADIUS server , and is used in the password hiding algorithm . 	301	0
2138	Request Authenticator	In Access-Request Packets , the Authenticator value is a 16 octet random number , called the Request Authenticator . The value SHOULD be unpredictable and unique over the lifetime of a secret ( the password shared between the client and the RADIUS server ), since repetition of a request value in conjunction with the same secret would permit an attacker to reply with a previously intercepted response . Since it is expected that the same secret MAY be used to authenticate with servers in disparate geographic regions , the Request Authenticator field SHOULD exhibit global and temporal uniqueness . 	230	0
2138	Response Authenticator	The value of the Authenticator field in Access-Accept , Access - Reject , and Access-Challenge packets is called the Response Authenticator , and contains a one-way MD5 hash calculated over a stream of octets consisting of : the RADIUS packet , beginning with the Code field , including the Identifier , the Length , the Request Authenticator field from the Access-Request packet , and the response Attributes , followed by the shared secret .

The E-bit represents OSPF's ExternalRoutingCapability . This bit should be set in all LSAs associated with the backbone , and all LSAs associated with non-stub areas ( see Section 3.6 ). It should also be set in all AS-external-LSAs . It should be reset in all router-LSAs , network-LSAs and summary-LSAs associated with a stub area . For all LSAs , the setting of the E-bit is for informational purposes only; it does not affect the routing table calculation . 	231	0
2178	LS type	The LS type field dictates the format and function of the LSA . LSAs of different types have different names ( e.g ., router-LSAs or network-LSAs ). All LSA types defined by this memo , except the AS - external-LSAs ( LS type = 5 ), are flooded throughout a single area only . AS-external-LSAs are flooded throughout the entire Autonomous System , excepting stub areas ( see Section 3.6 ). Each separate LSA type is briefly described below in Table 15 . 	231	0
2178	Link State ID	This field identifies the piece of the routing domain that is being described by the LSA . Depending on the LSA's LS type , the Link State ID takes on the values listed in Table 16 . 	230	0
2178	Advertising Router	This field specifies the OSPF Router ID of the LSA's originator . For router-LSAs , this field is identical to the Link State ID field . Network-LSAs are originated by the network's Designated Router . Summary-LSAs originated by area border routers . AS-external-LSAs are originated by AS boundary routers . 	230	0
2178	LS sequence number	The sequence number field is a signed 32-bit integer . It is used to detect old and duplicate LSAs . The space of sequence numbers is linearly ordered . The larger the sequence number ( when compared as signed 32-bit integers ) the more recent the LSA . To describe to sequence number space more precisely , let N refer in the discussion below to the constant 2**31 . 	200	0
2178	LS checksum	This field is the checksum of the complete contents of the LSA , excepting the LS age field . The LS age field is excepted so that an LSA's age can be incremented without updating the checksum . The checksum used is the same that is used for ISO connectionless datagrams; it is commonly referred to as the Fletcher checksum . It is documented in Annex B of [ Ref6 ]. The LSA header also contains the length of the LSA in bytes; subtracting the size of the LS age field ( two bytes ) yields the amount of data to checksum . 	400	0

2178	5	The stub networks are added to the tree in the procedure's second stage . In this stage , all router vertices are again examined . Those that have been determined to be unreachable in the above first phase are discarded . For each reachable router vertex ( call it V ), the associated router-LSA is found in the link state database . Each stub network link appearing in the LSA is then examined , and the following steps are executed : 	400	0

2178	1	( 2 ) The checksum field in the standard OSPF header is set to the standard IP checksum of the entire contents of the packet , starting with the OSPF packet header but excluding the 64-bit authentication field . This checksum is calculated as the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of all the 16-bit words in the packet , excepting the authentication field . If the packet's length is not an integral number of 16-bit words , the packet is padded with a byte of zero before checksumming . 	301	0

2190	HMV2	HMV2 , VMV2 : 7 bits each . Horizontal and vertical motion vector predictors for block number 3 in the first MB in this packet when four motion vectors are used with the advanced prediction option . This is needed because block number 3 in the MB needs different motion vector predictors from other blocks in the MB . These two fields are not used when the MB only has one motion vector . See the H.263 [ 4 ] for block organization in a macroblock . Each 7 bits field encodes a motion vector predictor in half pixel resolution as a 2's complement number . 	231	0

2250	MBZ	MBZ : Unused . Must be set to zero in current specification . This space is reserved for future use . 	500	0
2250	T	T : MPEG-2 ( Two ) specific header extension present ( 1 bit ). Set to 1 when the MPEG-2 video-specific header extension ( see Section 3.4.1 ) follows this header . This extension may be needed for improved error resilience; however , its inclusion in an RTP packet is optional . ( See Appendix 1 .) 	210	0
2250	TR	TR : Temporal-Reference ( 10 bits ). The temporal reference of the current picture within the current GOP . This value ranges from 0-1023 and is constant for all RTP packets of a given picture . 	230	0
2250	N	N : New picture header ( 1 bit ). Used for MPEG-2 payloads when the previous bit ( AN ) is set to 1 . Otherwise , it must be set to zero . Set to 1 when the information contained in the previously transmitted Picture Headers can't be used to reconstruct a header for the current picture . This happens when the current picture is encoded using a different set of parameters than the previous pictures of the same type . The N bit must be constant for all RTP packets that belong to the same picture so that receipt of any packet from a picture allows detecting whether information necessary for reconstruction was contained in that picture ( N = 1 ) or a previous one ( N = 0 ). 	210	0
2250	S	S : Sequence-header-present ( 1 bit ). Normally 0 and set to 1 at the occurrence of each MPEG sequence header . Used to detect presence of sequence header in RTP packet . 	210	0

2257	n_subid	The number ( 0-128 ) of sub-identifiers in the object identifier . An ordered list of " n_subid " 4-byte sub-identifiers follows the 4-byte header . 	231	0
2257	prefix	An unsigned value used to reduce the length of object identifier encodings . A non-zero value " x " is interpreted as the first sub-identifier after " internet " ( 1.3.6.1 ), and indicates an implicit prefix " internet.x " to the actual sub - identifiers encoded in the Object Identifier . For example , a prefix field value 2 indicates an implicit prefix " 1.3.6.1.2 ". A value of 0 in the prefix field indicates there is no prefix to the sub-identifiers . 	231	0
2257	include	Used only when the Object Identifier is the start of a SearchRange , as described in section 5.2 . 	201	0

2257	h.sessionID	The session ID uniquely identifies a session over which AgentX PDUs are exchanged between a subagent and the master agent . The session ID has no significance and no defined value in the agentx-Open-PDU sent by a subagent to open a session with the master agent; in this case , the master agent will assign a unique sessionID that it will pass back in the corresponding agentx-Response-PDU . From that point on , that same sessionID will appear in every AgentX PDU exchanged over that session between the master and the subagent . A subagent may establish multiple AgentX sessions by sending multiple agentx-Open-PDUs to the master agent . 	230	0
2257	h.transactionID	The transaction ID uniquely identifies , for a given session , the single SNMP management request ( and single SNMP PDU ) with which an AgentX PDU is associated . If a single SNMP management request results in multiple AgentX PDUs being sent by the master agent with the same sessionID , each of these AgentX PDUs must contain the same transaction ID; conversely , AgentX PDUs sent during a particular session , that result from distinct SNMP management requests , must have distinct transaction IDs within the limits of the 32-bit field ). 	230	0
2257	h.packetID	A packet ID generated by the sender for all AgentX PDUs except the agentx-Response-PDU . In an agentx-Response-PDU , the packet ID must be the same as that in the received AgentX PDU to which it is a response . A master agent might use this field to associate subagent response PDUs with their corresponding request PDUs . A subagent might use this field to correlate responses to multiple ( batched ) registrations . 	230	0
2257	h.payload_length	The size in octets of the PDU contents , excluding the 20-byte header . As a result of the encoding schemes and PDU layouts , this value will always be either 0 , or a multiple of 4 . 	100	0
2257	c.reason	An enumerated value that gives the reason that the master agent or subagent closed the AgentX session . This field may take one of the following values : 	230	0
2257	r.timeout	The length of time , in seconds , that a master agent should allow to elapse after dispatching a message to a subagent before it regards the subagent as not responding . r.timeout applies only to messages that concern MIB objects within r.region . It overrides both the subagent-wide value ( if any ) indicated when the AgentX session with the master agent was established , and the master agent's default timeout . The default value for r.timeout is 0 ( no override ). 	120	0
2257	r.priority	A value between 1 and 255 , used to achieve a desired configuration when different subagents register identical or overlapping regions . Subagents with no particular knowledge of priority should register with the default value of 255 ( lowest priority ). 	201	0
2257	r.range_subid	Permits specifying a range in place of one of r.region's sub - identifiers . If this value is 0 , no range is specified . Otherwise the " r.range_subid"-th sub-identifier in r.region is a range lower bound , and the range upper bound sub-identifier ( r.upper_bound ) immediately follows r.region . 	231	0
2257	u.priority	u.priority 	303	0
2257	h.sessionID	If this is a response to a agentx-Open-PDU , then it contains the new and unique sessionID ( as assigned by the master agent ) for this session . 	400	0
2257	h.transactionID	Must be identical to the h.transactionID value in the PDU to which this PDU is a response . 	231	0
2257	h.packetID	Must be identical to the h.packetID value in the PDU to which this PDU is a response . 	231	0
2257	res.sysUpTime	This field contains the current value of sysUpTime for the indicated context . It is relevant only in agentx response PDUs sent from the master agent to a subagent in response to the following agentx PDUs : 	400	0
2257	res.error	Indicates error status ( including ` noError '). Values are limited to those defined for errors in the SNMPv2 SMI ( RFC 1905 [ 4 ]), and the following AgentX-specific values : 	231	0
2257	res.index	In error cases , this is the index of the failed variable binding within a received request PDU . ( Note : As explained in section 5.4 , Value Representation , the index values of variable bindings within a variable binding list are 1-based .) 	231	0
2257	4	If r.region ( or any of its set of Object Identifiers , if r.range is non-zero ) is exactly the same as any currently registered value of r.region ( or any of its set of Object Identifiers ), this registration is termed a duplicate region . 	231	0
2257	1	Because AgentX supports overlapping registrations , it is possible for the master agent to obtain a value for a requested varbind from within multiple registered MIB regions . 	303	0
2257	2	The master agent may choose to send agentx-Get-PDUs while servicing an SNMP GetNextRequest-PDU . The master agent may choose to send agentx-Get-PDUs or agentx-GetNext-PDUs while servicing an SNMP GetBulkRequest-PDU . One possible reason for this would be if the current iteration has targeted instance-level registrations . 	231	0
2257	3	For Get/GetNext/GetBulk operations , at any stage of the possibly iterative process , the master agent may need to dispatch several SearchRanges to a particular subagent session . The master agent may send one , some , or all of the SearchRanges in a single AgentX PDU . 	303	0
2257	4	The master agent chooses a timeout value for each MIB region being queried , which is 	201	0
2257	5	If the master agent has determined that a specific non-default context is associated with the SNMP request PDU , that context is encoded into the AgentX PDU's context field and the NON_DEFAULT_CONTEXT bit is set in h.flags . 	400	0
2257	1	Within a lexicographically ordered set of OID ranges , valid for the indicated context , locate the authoritative region that contains the binding's name . 	400	0

2297	B	B : Bidirectional The Bidirectional flag applies only to the Add Branch message . In all other Connection Management messages it is not used . It may only be used when establishing a point - to-point connection . The Bidirectional flag in an Add Branch message , if set , requests that two unidirectional virtual channels or virtual paths be established , one in the forward direction , and one in the reverse direction . It is equivalent to two Add Branch messages , one specifying the forward direction , and one specifying the reverse direction . The forward direction uses the values of Input Port , Input VPI , Input VCI , Output Port , Output VPI , and Output VCI as specified in the Add Branch message . The reverse direction is derived by exchanging the values specified in the Input Port , Input VPI , and Input VCI fields , with those of the Output Port , Output VPI , and Output VCI fields respectively . Thus , a virtual connection in the reverse direction arrives at the input port specified by the Output Port field , on the VPI/VCI specified by the Output VPI and Output VCI fields .

2328	LS age	This field is the age of the LSA in seconds . It should be processed as an unsigned 16-bit integer . It is set to 0 when the LSA is originated . It must be incremented by InfTransDelay on every hop of the flooding procedure . LSAs are also aged as they are held in each router's database . 	121	0
2328	Options	The Options field in the LSA header indicates which optional capabilities are associated with the LSA . OSPF's optional capabilities are described in Section 4.5 . One optional capability is defined by this specification , represented by the E-bit found in the Options field . The unrecognized bits in the Options field should be set to zero . 	231	0
2328	LS type	The LS type field dictates the format and function of the LSA . LSAs of different types have different names ( e.g ., router-LSAs or network-LSAs ). All LSA types defined by this memo , except the AS-external-LSAs ( LS type = 5 ), are flooded throughout a single area only .

2328	LS sequence number	The sequence number field is a signed 32-bit integer . It is used to detect old and duplicate LSAs . The space of sequence numbers is linearly ordered . The larger the sequence number ( when compared as signed 32-bit integers ) the more recent the LSA . To describe to sequence number space more precisely , let N refer in the discussion below to the constant 2**31 . 	200	0
2328	LS checksum	This field is the checksum of the complete contents of the LSA , excepting the LS age field . The LS age field is excepted so that an LSA's age can be incremented without updating the checksum . The checksum used is the same that is used for ISO connectionless datagrams; it is commonly referred to as the Fletcher checksum . It is documented in Annex B of [ Ref6 ]. The LSA header also contains the length of the LSA in bytes; subtracting the size of the LS age field ( two bytes ) yields the amount of data to checksum . 	400	0

In the case of corruption or loss of the thread 0 representation , a representation of the sync frame with a higher thread number can be used by the decoder . Lower thread numbers are expected to contain equal or better representations of the sync frames than higher thread numbers in the absence of data corruption or loss . See [ 7 ] for a detailed discussion of VRC . 	201	0
2429	Trun	Trun : 4 bits Monotonically increasing ( modulo 16 ) 4 bit number counting the packet number within each thread . 	100	0
2429	S	S : 1 bit A bit that indicates that the packet content is for a sync frame . An encoder using VRC may send several representations of the same " sync " picture , in order to ensure that regardless of which thread of pictures is corrupted by errors or packet losses , the reception of at least one representation of a particular picture is ensured ( within at least one thread ). The sync picture can then be used for the prediction of any thread . If packet losses have not occurred , then the sync frame contents of thread 0 can be used and those of other threads can be discarded ( and similarly for other threads ). Thread 0 is considered the " canonical " thread , the use of which is preferable to all others . The contents of packets having lower thread numbers shall be considered as having a higher processing and delivery priority than those with higher thread numbers . Thus packets having lower thread numbers for a given sync frame shall be delivered first to the decoder under loss-free and 	210	0
2431	F	F : 1 bit When 0 , indicates the first field of a frame ( line 4 through 265 inclusive for Type=0 or 2 , and line 1 through 312 inclusive for Type=1 or 3 ). Any other scan line is considered a component of the second field , and the F bit will be set to 1 . This bit is copied directly from the BT.656-compliant stream by the transmitter , and inserted into the stream by the receiver . 	210	0
2431	V	V : 1 bit When 1 , indicates that the scan line is part of the vertical interval . Should always be 0 unless frame blanking data is sent . In which case , the V bit SHOULD be set to 1 for scan lines which do not form an integral part of the image . This bit is copied directly from the BT.656-compliant stream by the transmitter , and inserted into the stream by the receiver . For receivers which do not receive scan lines during the vertical interval , BT.656 vertical interval data MUST be generated by repeating the quad-sample sequence 0x80 , 0x10 , 0x80 , 0x10 , representing a true black level . 	210	0

Types 64-127 are the same as types 0-63 , except that restart markers are present in the JPEG data and a Restart Marker header appears immediately following the main JPEG header . Types 128-255 are free to be dynamically defined by a session setup protocol ( which is beyond the scope of this document ). 	231	0
2435	Q	The Q field defines the quantization tables for this frame . Q values 0-127 indicate the quantization tables are computed using an algorithm determined by the Type field ( see below ). Q values 128-255 indicate that a Quantization Table header appears after the main JPEG header ( and the Restart Marker header , if present ) in the first packet of the frame ( fragment offset 0 ). This header can be used to explicitly specify the quantization tables in-band . 	210	0

2741	1	If a subagent does not receive a response to its pings , or if it is able to detect ( from the underlying transport ) that the master agent is not able to receive AgentX messages , then it eventually must initiate a new AgentX session , re-register its MIB regions , etc . 	201	0
2741	1	Because AgentX supports registration of duplicate and overlapping regions , it is possible for the master agent to obtain a value for a requested varbind from within multiple registered MIB regions . 	400	0
2741	2	The master agent may choose to send agentx-Get-PDUs while servicing an SNMP GetNextRequest-PDU . The master agent may choose to send agentx-Get-PDUs or agentx-GetNext-PDUs while servicing an SNMP GetBulkRequest-PDU . One possible reason for this would be if the current iteration has targeted instance-level registrations . 	231	0
2741	3	For Get/GetNext/GetBulk operations , at any stage of the possibly iterative process , the master agent may need to dispatch several SearchRanges to a particular subagent session . The master agent may send one , some , or all of the SearchRanges in a single AgentX PDU . 	303	0

2892	PRI	This three bit field indicates the priority level of the SRP packet ( 0 through 7 ). The higher the value the higher the priority . Since there are only two queues in the transit buffer ( HPTB and LPTB ) a packet is treated as either low or high priority once it is on the ring . Each node determines the threshold value for determining what is considered a high priority packet and what is considered a low priority packet . However , the full 8 levels of priority in the SRP header can be used prior to transmission onto the ring ( transmit queues ) as well as after reception from the ring ( receive queues ). 	231	0

2975	Intra-domain	Much of the initial work on accounting management has focused on intra-domain accounting applications . However , with the increasing deployment of services such as dial-up roaming , Internet fax , Voice and Video over IP and QoS , applications requiring inter-domain accounting are becoming increasingly common . 	400	0
2975	Packet loss	As packet loss is a fact of life on the Internet , accounting protocols dealing with session data need to be resilient against packet loss . This is particularly important in inter-domain accounting , where packets often pass through Network Access Points 	400	0
2975	Device reboots	In the event of a device reboot , it is desirable to minimize the loss of data on sessions in progress . Such losses may be significant even if the devices themselves are very reliable , due to long-lived sessions , which can comprise a significant fraction of total resource consumption . To guard against loss of these high-value sessions , interim accounting data is typically transmitted over the wire . When interim accounting in-place is combined with non-volatile storage it becomes possible to guard against data loss in much shorter sessions . This is possible since interim accounting data need only be stored in non-volatile memory until the session completes , at which time the interim data may be replaced by the session record . As a result , interim accounting data need never be sent over the wire , and it is possible to decrease the interim interval so as to provide a very high degree of protection against data loss . 	302	0
2975	Memory	In accounting systems without non-volatile storage , accounting data must be stored in volatile memory during the period between when it is generated and when it is transferred . The resulting memory consumption will depend on retry and retransmission algorithms . Since systems designed for high reliability will typically wish to retry for long periods , or may store interim accounting data , the resulting memory consumption can be considerable . As a result , if non-volatile storage is unavailable , it may be desirable to compress accounting data awaiting transmission . 	120	0
2975	CPU requirements	CPU consumption of the managed and managing nodes will be proportional to the complexity of the required accounting processing . Operations such as ASN.1 encoding and decoding , compression/decompression , and encryption/decryption can consume considerable resources , both on accounting clients and servers . 	400	0

3292	M	M : Multicast Multicast flags are used as a hint for point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-point connections in the Add Branch message . They are not used in any other connection management messages and in these messages they SHOULD be set to zero . There are two instances of the M-bit in the Add Branch message; one for input branch specified by the Input Port and Input Label fields and one for the output branch specified by the Output Port and Output Label fields . If set for the input branch ( in front of Input Label field ), it indicates that the connection is very likely to be a point-to-multipoint connection . If zero , it indicates that this connection is very likely to be a point - to-point connection or is unknown . If set for the output branch ( in front of the Output Label field ), it indicates that the connection is very likely to be a multipoint-to-point connection . If zero , it indicates that this connection is very likely to be a point-to-point connection or is unknown . 	231	0
3292	B	B : Bi-directional The Bi-directional flag applies only to the Add Branch message . In all other Connection Management messages it is not used . It may only be used when establishing a point-to-point connection . The Bi-directional flag in an Add Branch message , if set , requests that two unidirectional connections be established , one in the forward direction , and one in the reverse direction . It is equivalent to two Add Branch messages , one specifying the forward direction , and one specifying the reverse direction . The forward direction uses the values of Input Port , Input Label , Output Port and Output Label as specified in the Add Branch message . The reverse direction is derived by exchanging the values specified in the Input Port and Input Label fields , with those of the Output Port and Output Label fields respectively . Thus , a connection in the reverse direction originates at the input port specified by the Output Port field , on the label specified by the Output Label field . It departs from the output port specified by the Input Port field , on the label specified by the Input Label field . 	231	0
3292	R	R : Connection Replace The Connection Replace flag applies only to the Add Branch message and is not used in any other Connection Management messages . The R flag is used in cases when creation of multipoint-to-point connections is undesirable ( e.g ., POTS applications where fan-in is meaningless ). If the R flag is set , the new connection replaces any existing connection if the label is already in use at the same Output Port . 	231	0
3292	R	R : Connection Replace The R flag shall only be checked when the Function field = 1 ( Bring Up ). If the R flag is set in the Port Management request message , it indicates that a switch controller requests the switch port to support the Connection Replace mechanism . 	210	0

The flag MUST be zero if any of the fields in this Activity Record are invalid , if the input port specified by the Input Port field does not exist , or if the specified connection does not exist . If the Valid Record flag is zero in a success response message , the Counter flag , the Activity flag , and the Traffic Count field are undefined . If the Valid Record flag is set , the Activity Record is valid , and the Counter and Activity flags are valid . The Valid Record flag is not used in the request message . 	210	0
3292	C	C : Counter In a success response message , if the Valid Record flag is set , the Counter flag , if zero , indicates that the value in the Traffic Count field is valid .

3550	SSRC	Synchronization source ( SSRC ): The source of a stream of RTP packets , identified by a 32-bit numeric SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header so as not to be dependent upon the network address . All packets from a synchronization source form part of the same timing and sequence number space , so a receiver groups packets by synchronization source for playback . Examples of synchronization sources include the sender of a stream of packets derived from a signal source such as a microphone or a camera , or an RTP mixer ( see below ). A synchronization source may change its data format , e.g ., audio encoding , over time . The SSRC identifier is a randomly chosen value meant to be globally unique within a particular RTP session ( see Section 8 ). A participant need not use the same SSRC identifier for all the RTP sessions in a multimedia session; the binding of the SSRC identifiers is provided through RTCP ( see Section 6.5.1 ). If a participant generates multiple streams in one RTP session , for example from separate video cameras , each MUST be identified as a different SSRC . 	230	0
3550	CSRC	Contributing source ( CSRC ): A source of a stream of RTP packets that has contributed to the combined stream produced by an RTP mixer ( see below ). The mixer inserts a list of the SSRC identifiers of the sources that contributed to the generation of a particular packet into the RTP header of that packet . This list is called the CSRC list . An example application is audio conferencing where a mixer indicates all the talkers whose speech 	230	0
3550	V	version ( V ): 2 bits This field identifies the version of RTP . The version defined by this specification is two ( 2 ). ( The value 1 is used by the first draft version of RTP and the value 0 is used by the protocol initially implemented in the " vat " audio tool .) 	220	0
3550	P	padding ( P ): 1 bit If the padding bit is set , the packet contains one or more additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the payload . The last octet of the padding contains a count of how many padding octets should be ignored , including itself . Padding may be needed by some encryption algorithms with fixed block sizes or for carrying several RTP packets in a lower-layer protocol data unit . 	231	0
3550	X	extension ( X ): 1 bit If the extension bit is set , the fixed header MUST be followed by exactly one header extension , with a format defined in Section 5.3.1 . 	210	0
3550	CC	CSRC count ( CC ): 4 bits The CSRC count contains the number of CSRC identifiers that follow the fixed header . 	231	0
3550	M	marker ( M ): 1 bit The interpretation of the marker is defined by a profile . It is intended to allow significant events such as frame boundaries to be marked in the packet stream . A profile MAY define additional marker bits or specify that there is no marker bit by changing the number of bits in the payload type field ( see Section 5.3 ). 	210	0
3550	PT	payload type ( PT ): 7 bits This field identifies the format of the RTP payload and determines its interpretation by the application . A profile MAY specify a default static mapping of payload type codes to payload formats . Additional payload type codes MAY be defined dynamically through non-RTP means ( see Section 3 ). A set of default mappings for audio and video is specified in the companion RFC 3551 [ 1 ]. An RTP source MAY change the payload type during a session , but this field SHOULD NOT be used for multiplexing separate media streams ( see Section 5.2 ). 	231	0
3550	sequence number	sequence number : 16 bits The sequence number increments by one for each RTP data packet sent , and may be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence . The initial value of the sequence number SHOULD be random ( unpredictable ) to make known-plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult , even if the source itself does not encrypt according to the method in Section 9.1 , because the packets may flow through a translator that does . Techniques for choosing unpredictable numbers are discussed in [ 17 ]. 	200	0
3550	timestamp	timestamp : 32 bits The timestamp reflects the sampling instant of the first octet in the RTP data packet . The sampling instant MUST be derived from a clock that increments monotonically and linearly in time to allow synchronization and jitter calculations ( see Section 6.4.1 ). The resolution of the clock MUST be sufficient for the desired synchronization accuracy and for measuring packet arrival jitter ( one tick per video frame is typically not sufficient ). The clock frequency is dependent on the format of data carried as payload and is specified statically in the profile or payload format specification that defines the format , or MAY be specified dynamically for payload formats defined through non-RTP means . If RTP packets are generated periodically , the nominal sampling instant as determined from the sampling clock is to be used , not a reading of the system clock . As an example , for fixed-rate audio the timestamp clock would likely increment by one for each sampling period . If an audio application reads blocks covering 	121	0
3550	SSRC	SSRC : 32 bits The SSRC field identifies the synchronization source . This identifier SHOULD be chosen randomly , with the intent that no two synchronization sources within the same RTP session will have the same SSRC identifier . An example algorithm for generating a random identifier is presented in Appendix A.6 . Although the probability of multiple sources choosing the same identifier is low , all RTP implementations must be prepared to detect and resolve collisions . Section 8 describes the probability of collision along with a mechanism for resolving collisions and detecting RTP-level forwarding loops based on the uniqueness of the SSRC identifier . If a source changes its source transport address , it must also choose a new SSRC identifier to avoid being interpreted as a looped source ( see Section 8.2 ). 	230	0
3550	V	version ( V ): 2 bits Identifies the version of RTP , which is the same in RTCP packets as in RTP data packets . The version defined by this specification is two ( 2 ). 	220	0
3550	P	padding ( P ): 1 bit If the padding bit is set , this individual RTCP packet contains some additional padding octets at the end which are not part of the control information but are included in the length field . The last octet of the padding is a count of how many padding octets should be ignored , including itself ( it will be a multiple of four ). Padding may be needed by some encryption algorithms with fixed block sizes . In a compound RTCP packet , padding is only required on one individual packet because the compound packet is encrypted as a whole for the method in Section 9.1 . Thus , padding MUST only be added to the last individual packet , and if padding is added to that packet , the padding bit MUST be set only on that packet . This convention aids the header validity checks described in Appendix A.2 and allows detection of packets from some early implementations that incorrectly set the padding bit on the first individual packet and add padding to the last individual packet . 	231	0
3550	RC	reception report count ( RC ): 5 bits The number of reception report blocks contained in this packet . A value of zero is valid . 	302	0
3550	PT	packet type ( PT ): 8 bits Contains the constant 200 to identify this as an RTCP SR packet . 	231	0
3550	length	length : 16 bits The length of this RTCP packet in 32-bit words minus one , including the header and any padding . ( The offset of one makes zero a valid length and avoids a possible infinite loop in scanning a compound RTCP packet , while counting 32-bit words avoids a validity check for a multiple of 4 .) 	100	0
3550	SSRC	SSRC : 32 bits The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this SR packet . 	230	0
3550	RTP timestamp	RTP timestamp : 32 bits Corresponds to the same time as the NTP timestamp ( above ), but in the same units and with the same random offset as the RTP timestamps in data packets . This correspondence may be used for intra - and inter-media synchronization for sources whose NTP timestamps are synchronized , and may be used by media-independent receivers to estimate the nominal RTP clock frequency . Note that in most cases this timestamp will not be equal to the RTP timestamp in any adjacent data packet . Rather , it MUST be calculated from the corresponding NTP timestamp using the relationship between the RTP timestamp counter and real time as maintained by periodically checking the wallclock time at a sampling instant . 	122	0
3550	sender's packet count	sender's packet count : 32 bits The total number of RTP data packets transmitted by the sender since starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was generated . The count SHOULD be reset if the sender changes its SSRC identifier . 	200	0
3550	sender's octet count	sender's octet count : 32 bits The total number of payload octets ( i.e ., not including header or padding ) transmitted in RTP data packets by the sender since starting transmission up until the time this SR packet was generated . The count SHOULD be reset if the sender changes its SSRC identifier . This field can be used to estimate the average payload data rate . 	100	0
3550	fraction lost	fraction lost : 8 bits The fraction of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n lost since the previous SR or RR packet was sent , expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point at the left edge of the field . ( That is equivalent to taking the integer part after multiplying the loss fraction by 256 .) This fraction is defined to be the number of packets lost divided by the number of packets expected , as defined in the next paragraph . An implementation is shown in Appendix A.3 . If the loss is negative due to duplicates , the fraction lost is set to zero . Note that a receiver cannot tell whether any packets were lost after the last one received , and that there will be no reception report block issued for a source if all packets from that source sent during the last reporting interval have been lost . 	201	0
3550	cumulative number of packets lost	cumulative number of packets lost : 24 bits The total number of RTP data packets from source SSRC_n that have been lost since the beginning of reception . This number is defined to be the number of packets expected less the number of packets actually received , where the number of packets received includes any which are late or duplicates . Thus , packets that arrive late are not counted as lost , and the loss may be negative if there are duplicates . The number of packets expected is defined to be the extended last sequence number received , as defined next , less the initial sequence number received . This may be calculated as shown in Appendix A.3 . 	200	0
3550	extended highest sequence number received	extended highest sequence number received : 32 bits The low 16 bits contain the highest sequence number received in an RTP data packet from source SSRC_n , and the most significant 16 bits extend that sequence number with the corresponding count of sequence number cycles , which may be maintained according to the algorithm in Appendix A.1 . Note that different receivers within the same session will generate different extensions to the sequence number if their start times differ significantly . 	200	0
3550	interarrival jitter	interarrival jitter : 32 bits An estimate of the statistical variance of the RTP data packet interarrival time , measured in timestamp units and expressed as an unsigned integer . The interarrival jitter J is defined to be the mean deviation ( smoothed absolute value ) of the difference D in packet spacing at the receiver compared to the sender for a pair of packets . As shown in the equation below , this is equivalent to the difference in the " relative transit time " for the two packets; 	122	0

3868	Address Indicator	This parameter is needed for interworking with SS7 networks . The address indicator specifies what address parameters are actually received in the SCCP address from the SS7 network , or are to be populated in the SCCP address when the message is sent into the SS7 network . The value of the routing indicator needs to be taken into account . It is used in the ASP to SG direction . For example , the PC parameter is present in the destination address of the CLDT sent from ASP->SG , but bit 2 is set to " 0 " meaning " do not populate this in the SCCP called party address ". The effect is that the SG only uses the PC to populate the MTP routing label DPC field , but does not include it in the SCCP called party address . 	230	0
3868	GTI	0000 Invalid 0001 Nature of Address is taken over . It is implicitly assumed that the Translation Type = Unknown and Numbering Plan = E.164 ( value 1 ). 0010 This is most commonly used in North American networks .

3931	Session ID	A 32-bit field containing a non-zero identifier for a session . L2TP sessions are named by identifiers that have local significance only . That is , the same logical session will be given different Session IDs by each end of the control connection for the life of the session . When the L2TP control connection is used for session establishment , Session IDs are selected and exchanged as Local Session ID AVPs during the creation of a session . The Session ID alone provides the necessary context for all further packet processing , including the presence , size , and value of the Cookie , the type of L2-Specific Sublayer , and the type of payload being tunneled . 	202	0
3931	Ns	The message sequence number , Ns , begins at 0 . Each subsequent message is sent with the next increment of the sequence number . The sequence number is thus a free-running counter represented modulo 65536 . The sequence number in the header of a received message is considered less than or equal to the last received number if its value lies in the range of the last received number and the preceding 32767 values , inclusive . For example , if the last received sequence number was 15 , then messages with sequence numbers 0 through 15 , as well as 32784 through 65535 , would be considered less than or equal . Such a message would be considered a duplicate of a message already received and ignored from processing . However , in order to ensure that all messages are acknowledged properly ( particularly in the case of a lost ACK message ), receipt of duplicate messages MUST be acknowledged by the reliable delivery mechanism . This acknowledgment may either piggybacked on a message in queue or sent explicitly via an ACK message . 	201	0

If the control message containing the unrecognized AVP is associated with a session ( e.g ., an ICRQ , ICRP , ICCN , SLI , etc .), then the session MUST be issued a CDN with a Result Code of 2 and Error Code of 8 ( as defined in Section 5.4.2 ) and shut down . If the control message containing the unrecognized AVP is associated with establishment or maintenance of a Control Connection ( e.g ., SCCRQ , SCCRP , SCCCN , Hello ), then the associated Control Connection MUST be issued a StopCCN with Result Code of 2 and Error Code of 8 ( as defined in Section 5.4.2 ) and shut down . If the M bit is not set on an unrecognized AVP , the AVP MUST be ignored when received , processing the control message as if the AVP were not present . 	210	0
3931	Message Type	The Message Type AVP , Attribute Type 0 , identifies the control message herein and defines the context in which the exact meaning of the following AVPs will be determined . 	240	0
3931	M	The Mandatory ( M ) bit within the Message Type AVP has special meaning . Rather than an indication as to whether the AVP itself should be ignored if not recognized , it is an indication as to whether the control message itself should be ignored . If the M bit is set within the Message Type AVP and the Message Type is unknown to the implementation , the control connection MUST be cleared . If the M bit is not set , then the implementation may ignore an unknown message type . The M bit MUST be set to 1 for all message types defined in this document . This AVP MUST NOT be hidden ( the H bit MUST be 0 ). The Length of this AVP is 8 . 	210	0

4585	BLP	bitmask of following lost packets ( BLP ): 16 bits The BLP allows for reporting losses of any of the 16 RTP packets immediately following the RTP packet indicated by the PID . The BLP's definition is identical to that given in [ 6 ]. Denoting the BLP's least significant bit as bit 1 , and its most significant bit as bit 16 , then bit i of the bit mask is set to 1 if the receiver has not received RTP packet number ( PID+i ) ( modulo 2^16 ) and indicates this packet is lost; bit i is set to 0 otherwise . Note that the sender MUST NOT assume that a receiver has received a packet because its bit mask was set to 0 . For example , the least significant bit of the BLP would be set to 1 if the packet corresponding to the PID and the following packet have been lost . However , the sender cannot infer that packets PID+2 through PID+16 have been received simply because bits 2 through 15 of the BLP are 0; all the sender knows is that the receiver has not reported them as lost at this time . 	231	0
4585	First	First : 13 bits The macroblock ( MB ) address of the first lost macroblock . The MB numbering is done such that the macroblock in the upper left corner of the picture is considered macroblock number 1 and the number for each macroblock increases from left to right and then from top to bottom in raster-scan order ( such that if there is a total of N macroblocks in a picture , the bottom right macroblock is considered macroblock number N ). 	230	0

4587	MBAP	Encodes the macroblock address predictor ( i.e ., the last MBA encoded in the previous packet ). This predictor ranges from 0 - 32 ( to predict the valid MBAs 1 - 33 ), but because the bit stream cannot be fragmented between a GOB header and MB 1 , the predictor at the start of the packet shall not be 0 . Therefore , the range is 1 - 32 , which is biased by - 1 to fit in 5 bits . For example , if MBAP is 0 , the value of the MBA predictor is 1 . Set to 0 if the packet begins with a GOB header . 	230	0

4587	HMVD	Reference horizontal motion vector data ( MVD ). Set to 0 if V flag is 0 or if the packet begins with a GOB header , or when the MTYPE of the last MB encoded in the previous packet was not motion compensation ( MC ). HMVD is encoded as a 2s complement number , and ' 10000 ' corresponding to the value - 16 is forbidden ( motion vector fields range from +/- 15 ). 	210	0
4587	VMVD	Reference vertical motion vector data ( MVD ). Set to 0 if V flag is 0 or if the packet begins with a GOB header , or when the MTYPE of the last MB encoded in the previous packet was not MC . VMVD is encoded as a 2s complement number , and ' 10000 ' corresponding to the value - 16 SHALL not be used ( motion vector fields range from +/- 15 ). 	210	0

4598	NF	o Number of frames/fragments ( NF ): An 8-bit field whose meaning depends on the Frame Type ( F ) in this payload . For complete frames ( F of 0 ), it is used to indicate the number of E-AC-3 frames in the RTP payload .

4629	P	Indicates the picture start or a picture segment ( GOB/Slice ) start or a video sequence end ( EOS or EOSBS ). Two bytes of zero bits then have to be prefixed to the payload of such a packet to compose a complete picture/GOB/slice/EOS/EOSBS start code . This bit allows the omission of the two first bytes of the start codes , thus improving the compression ratio . 	110	0
4629	V	Indicates the presence of an 8-bit field containing information for Video Redundancy Coding ( VRC ), which follows immediately after the initial 16 bits of the payload header , if present . For syntax and semantics of that 8-bit VRC field , see Section 5.2 . 	400	0

4629	TID	Thread ID . Up to 7 threads are allowed . Each frame of H.263 + VRC data will use as reference information only sync frames or frames within the same thread . By convention , thread 0 is expected to be the " canonical " thread , which is the thread from which the sync frame should ideally be used . In the case of corruption or loss of the thread 0 representation , a representation of the sync frame with a higher thread number can be used by the decoder . Lower thread numbers are expected to contain representations of the sync frames equal to or better than higher thread numbers in the absence of data corruption or loss .

An encoder using VRC may send several representations of the same " sync " picture , in order to ensure that , regardless of which thread of pictures is corrupted by errors or packet losses , the reception of at least one representation of a particular picture is ensured ( within at least one thread ). The sync picture can then be used for the prediction of any thread . If packet losses have not occurred , then the sync frame contents of thread 0 can be used , and those of other threads can be discarded ( and similarly for other threads ). Thread 0 is considered the " canonical " thread , the use of which is preferable 	210	0

It is said to be a signed 4-byte value to make any Java implementations easier ( or any other implementations without unsigned values); however , no negative lengths are valid . 	100	0
4678	Message ID	o Message ID : Each request message is given a 4-byte Message ID by the message originator , which is simply returned in the Message ID field of the reply . This field is meant to assist the requester in correlating replies to the appropriate request when many requests have been sent . In the Send Weights message ( the only message transaction that has no reply ), this field serves no purpose . 	230	0
4678	Protocol	o Protocol : The assigned number of the IP transport layer used in the Protocol Field of the IP header . These are defined in [ RFC1700 ]; however , a current list is maintained at http://www.iana.org . for example : TCP = 0x06 , UDP = 0x11 , etc . 	231	0
4678	Port	o Port : The port number used for communication to the member . *** A value of 0 can be given for the Protocol and Port to signify a system level member . However , 0 shouldn't be perceived as a wildcard for either Port or Protocol fields ( i.e ., a deregistration request that includes a MemberData component with a 0 for the port doesn't mean deregister all applications listening on any port of that IP and protocol ). 	230	0
4678	Label	o Label : A UTF8 string that may be set while registering a member . This string is opaque to the GWM and is simply included with any correspondence containing the member data component . Note that the size of this label is <= 255 bytes . Because UTF8 character encodings may be up to 6 bytes , care must be exercised by the load balancer or member to make sure the UTF8 string it sends the GWM is in fact <= 255 bytes . 	400	0
4678	LB UID Length	o LB UID : A UTF8 string used as a unique identifier and a context for the Group Name ( e.g ., a UTF8 representation of the MAC address of the load balancer or some type of Universally Unique Identifier ( UUID )). This string is used by the Group Workload Manager to associate application registration and deregistration , and to set state messages with the correct load balancer . This unique identifier should not be any longer than 64 bytes . 	231	0

4678	State Field	o State Field : This field is used by the member to communicate state information to the scheduler . The information placed in this field is opaque to the GWM and will simply be forwarded to the scheduler with the member weights . There are no defined values for this field . 	400	0
4678	Flags Field	o Flags Field : This field has several flag values that describe several attributes of the member . 	231	0
4678	Weight	o Weight : This field represents the GWM's recommendation for the relative amount of work that should be sent to this member . This is a 16-bit field with a possible range of 0 to 65536 . Load balancers should be prepared to receive a wide range of weight values . Load balancers with limited maximum weight values may restrict the granularity of management by the GWM and in turn cause less than optimal performance . Many existing implementations have supported a minimum raw weight range from 0 to 100 . 	231	0
4678	State Field	o State Field : This field is used by the member to communicate state information to the load balancer or scheduler . There are no defined values for this field . 	400	0
4678	Flags Field	o Flags Field : This field describes attributes of the member . Currently the only flag value defined is that of the quiesce flag . The quiesce flag is used when an administrator would like to temporarily remove a member from the weight calculation , but not deregister it from the group . When quiesced , the member will still show up in the weights , but the quiesce flag will be set , 	231	0

4712	P	padding ( P ): 1 bit - If the padding bit is set , the BASIC part of the RAQMON PDU contains some additional padding octets at the end of the BASIC part of the PDU that are not part of the monitoring information . Padding may be needed in some cases , as reporting is based on the intent of a RDS to report certain parameters . Also , some parameters may be reported only once at the beginning of the reporting session , e.g ., Data Source Name , Receiver Name , payload type , etc . Actual padding at the end of the BASIC part of the PDU is 0 , 8 , 16 , or 24 bits to make the length of the BASIC part of the PDU a multiple of 32 bits 	231	0

4712	DSRC	DSRC : 32 bits - Data Source identifier represents a unique RAQMON reporting session descriptor that points to a specific reporting session between RDS and RRC . Uniqueness of DSRC is valid only within a reporting session . DSRC values should be randomly generated using vendor-chosen algorithms for each communication session . It is not sufficient to obtain a DSRC simply by calling random () without carefully initializing the state . One could use an algorithm like the one defined in Appendix A.6 in [ RFC3550 ] to create a DSRC . Depending on the choice of algorithm , there is a finite probability that two DSRCs from two different RDSs may be the same . To further reduce the probability that two RDSs pick the same DSRC for two different reporting sessions , it is recommended that an RRC use parameters like Data Source Address ( DA ), Data Source Name ( DN ), and layer 2 Media Access Control ( MAC ) Address in the PDU in conjunction with a DSRC value . It is not mandatory for RDSs to send parameters like Data Source Address ( DA ), Data Source Name ( DN ), and MAC Address in every PDU sent to RRC , but occasionally sending these parameters will reduce the probability of DSRC collision drastically . However , this will cause an additional overhead per PDU . 	231	0
4712	RC_N	RC_N : 8 bits - The Record Count number indicates a sub-session within a communication session . A value of zero is a valid record number . The maximum number of records that can be described in one RAQMON Packet is 256 . 	110	0

4793	Highest	This field contains an unsigned integer representing the highest protocol version supported by the sender . If a value provided by a peer to an EAP server falls between the server's " Highest " and " Lowest " supported version ( inclusive ), then that value will be the negotiated version for the authentication session . 	220	0
4793	Lowest	This field contains an unsigned integer representing the lowest version acceptable by the EAP server . The field MUST be present in an EAP-Request . The field MUST NOT be present in an EAP - Response . A peer SHALL respond to an EAP-Request of type POTP-X with an EAP-Response of type Nak ( 3 ) if the peer's highest supported version is lower than the value of this field . 	231	0

4793	A	The A bit MUST be set in an EAP-Request if and only if the request immediately follows an EAP-Response of type POTP-X containing a New PIN TLV ( see Section 4.11.5 ), and the new PIN in the response was accepted by the EAP server . In this case , the A bit signals that the EAP-server has accepted the PIN , and that the peer SHALL use the newly established PIN when calculating the response ( when applicable ). The A bit MUST NOT be set if the S bit is set . If a request has both the S bit and the A bit set , the peer SHALL regard the request as invalid , and return an empty POTP-X EAP - Response message . 	210	0
4793	P	In an EAP-Request , the P bit indicates that the OTP in the response MUST be protected . Use of this bit also indicates that mutual authentication will take place , as well as generation of keying material . It is RECOMMENDED to always set the P bit . If a peer receives an EAP-Request with an OTP TLV that does not have the P bit set , and the peer's policy dictates protected mode , the peer MUST respond with an empty POTP-X EAP-Response message . All peers MUST support protected mode . 	210	0
4793	C	The C bit carries meaning only when the OTP algorithm in question makes use of server challenges . For other OTP algorithms , the C bit SHALL always be set to zero . 	210	0
4793	N	In an EAP-Request , the N bit , when set , indicates that the OTP to calculate SHALL be based on the next token " state ", and not the current one . As an example , for a time-based token , this means the next time slot . For an event-based token , this could mean the next counter value , if counter values are used . This bit will normally not be set in initial EAP-Request messages , but may be set in subsequent ones . Further , the N bit carries no meaning in an EAP-Request if a challenge is present and the C bit is not set , and SHALL be set to 0 , in this case . If a request that has the N bit set also contains a challenge , but does not have the C bit set , the peer SHALL regard the request as invalid , and return an empty POTP-X EAP-Response message . Note that setting the N bit in an EAP-Request will normally advance the internal state of the token . 	210	0
4793	T	The T bit only carries meaning for OTP methods normally incorporating a user PIN in the OTP computation . 	231	0
4793	E	In an EAP-Request , the E bit , when set , indicates that the peer MUST NOT use any stored pepper value associated with this server in the PBKDF2 computation . Rather , it MUST generate a new pepper ( if supported by the peer ) and/or use the iteration count parameter to protect the OTP ( if the server's Max Pepper Length is 0 , then the peer MUST rely on the iteration count only to protect the OTP ). This bit will usually not be set in initial EAP-Request messages , but may be set in subsequent ones , e.g ., if the server , upon receipt of an OTP TLV with a pepper identifier , detects that it does not have a pepper with that identifier in storage . This bit carries no meaning , and MUST be set to zero , when the P bit is not set . If a request has the E bit set but not the P bit , a peer SHALL regard the request as invalid , and return an empty POTP-X EAP-Response message . 	210	0
4793	S	In an EAP-Request , the S bit (" Same "), when set , indicates that the peer SHOULD calculate its response based on the same OTP value as was used for the preceding response . This bit MAY be set when the EAP server has received an OTP TLV from the peer protected with a pepper , of which the server is no longer in possession . Since the server has not attempted validation of the provided data , there is no need for the EAP peer to retrieve a new OTP value . This bit carries no meaning , and MUST be set to zero , when the E bit is not set . A peer SHALL regard a request where the S bit is set , but not the E bit , as invalid , and return an empty POTP-X EAP-Response message . Further , the S bit MUST NOT be set when the A bit also is set; see above . 	210	0
4793	Pepper Length	This octet SHALL be present if and only if the P bit is set . When present , it contains an unsigned integer , having a value between 0 and 255 ( inclusive ). In an EAP-Request , the integer represents the maximum length ( in bits ) of a client-generated pepper the server is prepared to search for . Peers MUST NOT generate peppers longer than this value . If the value is set to zero , it means the peer MUST NOT generate a pepper for the PBKDF2 calculation . In an EAP-Response , it indicates the length of the used pepper . 	301	0
4793	Iteration Count	These 4 octets SHALL be present if and only if the P bit is set . When present , they contain an unsigned , 4-octet integer in network byte order . In an EAP-Request , the integer represents the maximum iteration count the peer may use in the PBKDF2 computation . Peers MUST NOT use iteration counts higher than this value . In an EAP - Response , it indicates the actual iteration count used . 	301	0
4793	Authentication Data	EAP-Request : In an EAP-Request , the Authentication Data field , when present , contains an optional " challenge ". The challenge is an octet string that SHOULD be uniquely generated for each request in which it is present ( i.e ., it is a " nonce "), and SHOULD be 8 octets or longer . To avoid fragmentation ( i.e ., EAP messages longer than the minimum EAP MTU size; see [ 1 ]), the challenge MUST NOT be longer than 64 octets . When the challenge is not present , the OTP will be calculated on the current token state only . The peer MAY ignore a provided challenge if and only if the OTP token the peer is interacting with is not capable of including a challenge in the OTP calculation . In this case , EAP server policies will determine whether or not to accept a provided OTP value . 	400	0

4793	Q	The Q bit , when set in an EAP-Request , indicates that an accompanying PIN is required , i.e ., the peer ( user ) is not free to choose another PIN . When the Q bit is set , there MUST be an accompanying PIN and the provided PIN MUST be used in subsequent OTP generations . A peer SHALL respond with an empty POTP-X EAP - Response message if the Q bit is set but there is not any accompanying PIN . When the Q bit is not set , any provided PIN is suggested only , and the peer is free to choose another PIN , subject to local policy . 	210	0
4793	A	This bit allows methods that distinguish between two different PIN types ( e.g ., decimal vs . alphanumeric ) to designate whether the augmented set is to be used ( when set ) or not ( when not set ). The A bit carries no meaning , and SHALL be set to zero , in an EAP - Response . 	210	0

4973	0x8d	A significant difference between a native OSPF network and a TE network is that the latter may be subject to frequent real-time circuit pinning and is likely to undergo TE-state updates . Some links might undergo changes more frequently than others . Flooding the network with TE-router LSAs at the aggregated speed of all link metric changes is simply not desirable . A smaller in size TE - incremental-link-update LSA is designed to advertise only the incremental link updates . 	303	0
4973	Link State ID	This would be exactly the same as would have been specified for Link ID , for a link within the router LSA . 	400	0
4973	Link Data	This specifies the router ID the link belongs to . In majority of cases , this would be same as the advertising router . This choice for Link Data is primarily to facilitate proxy advertisement for incremental link updates . 	230	0
4973	Link State ID	The ID of the far-end router or the far-end link-ID to which the TE circuit path(s ) is being advertised . 	230	0

4973	No . of TE Circuit Paths	This specifies the number of pre-engineered TE circuit paths between the advertising router and the router specified in the Link State ID . 	230	0
4973	Circuit-TE ID	This is the ID of the far-end router for a given TE circuit path segment . 	230	0
4973	Circuit-TE Data	This is the virtual link identifier on the near-end router for a given TE circuit path segment . This can be a private interface or handle the near-end router uses to identify the virtual link . 	230	0
4973	Circuit-TE flags	This lists the zero or more TE-link TLVs that all member elements of the LSP meet . 	400	0
4973	0x83	A TE-Summary network LSA may be used to advertise reachability of TE-networks accessible to areas external to the originating area . The content and the flooding scope of a TE-Summary LSA is different from that of a native Summary LSA . 	231	0
4973	0x84	A TE-Summary router LSA may be used to advertise the availability of area border routers ( ABRs ) and AS border routers ( ASBRs ) that are TE-capable . The TE-Summary router LSAs are originated by the Area Border Routers . The scope of flooding for the TE-Summary router LSA is the non-backbone area the advertising ABR belongs to . 	400	0
4973	Link State ID	The ID of the area border router or the AS border router whose TE capability is being advertised . 	230	0
4973	Advertising Router	The ABR that advertises its TE capabilities ( and the OSPF areas it belongs to ) or the TE capabilities of an ASBR within one of the areas for which the ABR is a border router . 	231	0
4973	No . of Areas	No . of Areas 	400	0
4973	Area-ID	Specifies the OSPF area(s ) the link state ID belongs to . When the link state ID is same as the advertising router ID , the Area-ID lists all the areas the ABR belongs to . In the case the link state ID is an ASBR , the Area-ID simply lists the area the ASBR belongs to . The advertising router is assumed to be the ABR from the same area the ASBR is located in . 	231	0

4973	Router-TE TLVs	Router-TE flags , Router-TE TLVs 	231	0
4973	0x85	TE-AS-external LSAs are the Type 0x85 LSAs . This is modeled after AS-external LSA format and flooding scope . TE-AS-external LSAs are originated by AS boundary routers with TE extensions , and describe the TE networks and pre-engineered circuit paths external to the AS . As with AS-external LSA , the flooding scope of the TE-AS-external LSA is AS-wide , with the exception of stub areas . 	400	0
4973	Network Mask	The IP address mask for the advertised TE destination . For example , this can be used to specify access to a specific TE node or TE link with an mask of 0xffffffff . This can also be used to specify access to an aggregated set of destinations using a different mask . ex : 0xff000000 . 	230	0
4973	Link-TE flags	The TE attributes of this route . These fields are optional and are provided only when one or more pre-engineered circuits can be specified with the advertisement . Without these fields , the LSA will simply state TE reachability info . 	400	0
4973	Link-TE TLVs	The TE attributes of this route . These fields are optional and are provided only when one or more pre-engineered circuits can be specified with the advertisement . Without these fields , the LSA will simply state TE reachability info . 	400	0
4973	Forwarding address	Data traffic for the advertised destination will be forwarded to this address . If the Forwarding address is set to 0.0.0.0 , data traffic will be forwarded instead to the LSA's originator ( i.e ., the responsible AS boundary router ). 	230	0
4973	External Route Tag	A 32-bit field attached to each external route . This is not used by the OSPF protocol itself . It may be used to communicate information between AS boundary routers; the precise nature of such information is outside the scope of this specification . 	400	0
4973	0x81	The following fields are used to describe each router link ( i.e ., interface ). Each router link is typed ( see the below Type field ). The Type field indicates the kind of link being described . 	240	0
4973	Type	A new link type " Positional-Ring Type " ( value 5 ) is defined . This is essentially a connection to a TDM-Ring . TDM ring network is different from LAN/NBMA transit network in that nodes on the TDM ring do not necessarily have a terminating path between themselves . Second , the order of links is important in determining the circuit path . Third , the protection switching and the number of fibers from a node going into a ring are determined by the ring characteristics , for example , 2-fiber vs . 4-fiber ring and Unidirectional Path Switched Ring ( UPSR ) vs . Bidirectional Line Switched Ring ( BLSR ). 	231	0

4973	Link ID	Identifies the object that this router link connects to . Value depends on the link's Type . For a positional-ring type , the Link ID shall be IP Network/Subnet number just as the case with a broadcast transit network . The following table summarizes the updated Link ID values . 	231	0
4973	Type	Type Link ID ______________________________________ 1 Neighboring router's Router ID 2 IP address of Designated Router 3 IP network/subnet number 4 Neighboring router's Router ID 5 IP network/subnet number 	240	0

4973	LSC	TDM , LSC , FSC bits - Same as defined for router TE options . 	400	0
4973	0x82	Network LSA is adequate for packet TE networks . A new TE - positional-ring-network LSA is defined to represent type-5 link networks , found in non-packet networks such as SONET/SDH TDM rings . A type-5 ring is a collection of network elements ( NEs ) forming a closed loop . Each NE is connected to two adjacent NEs via a duplex connection to provide redundancy in the ring . The sequence in which the NEs are placed on the Ring is pertinent . The NE that provides the OSPF-xTE functionality is termed the Gateway Network Element ( GNE ). The GNE selection criteria is outside the scope of this document . The GNE is also termed the Designated Router for the ring . 	400	0
4973	Link State ID	This is the IP interface address of the network's Gateway Network Element , which is also the designated router . 	230	0
4973	Advertising Router	Advertising Router 	230	0
4973	Capacity Unit	Capacity Unit 	400	0
4973	Ring capacity	Ring capacity 	302	0
4973	Network Element Node Id	The Router ID of each of the routers in the positional-ring network . The list must start with the designated router as the first element . The Network Elements ( NEs ) must be listed in strict clockwise order as they appear on the ring , starting with the Gateway Network Element ( GNE ). The number of NEs in the ring can be deduced from the LSA header's length field . 	230	0
4973	0x8e	This is a variation to the TE-router LSA in that the TE-router LSA is not advertised by the network element , but rather by a trusted TE - router Proxy . This is typically the scenario in a non-packet TE network , where some of the nodes do not have OSPF functionality and count on a helper node to do the advertisement for them . One such example would be the SONET/SDH Add-Drop Multiplexer ( ADM ) nodes in a TDM ring . The nodes may principally depend upon the GNE ( Gateway Network Element ) to do the advertisement for them . TE-router-Proxy LSA shall not be used to advertise area border routers and/or AS border routers . 	301	0
4973	Type	The OSPF interface type can also be of type " Positional-Ring ". The Positional-Ring type is different from other types ( such as broadcast and NBMA ) in that the exact location of the nodes on the ring is relevant , even though they are all on the same ring . SONET ADM ring is a good example of this . Complete ring positional-ring description may be provided by the GNE on a ring as a TE-network LSA for the ring . 	231	0

5206	Locator	This document defines a generalization of an address called a " locator ". A locator specifies a point-of-attachment to the network but may also include additional end-to-end tunneling or per-host demultiplexing context that affects how packets are handled below the logical HIP sublayer of the stack . This generalization is useful because IP addresses alone may not be sufficient to describe how packets should be handled below HIP . For example , in a host multihoming context , certain IP addresses may need to be associated with certain ESP SPIs to avoid violating the ESP anti-replay window . Addresses may also be affiliated with transport ports in certain tunneling scenarios . Locators may simply be traditional network addresses . The format of the locator fields in the LOCATOR parameter is defined in Section 4 . 	230	0

5440	Pri	o Pri ( Priority - 3 bits ): the Priority field may be used by the requesting PCC to specify to the PCE the request's priority from 1 to 7 . The decision of which priority should be used for a specific request is a local matter; it MUST be set to 0 when unused . Furthermore , the use of the path computation request priority by the PCE's scheduler is implementation specific and out of the scope of this document . Note that it is not required for a PCE to support the priority field : in this case , it is RECOMMENDED that the PCC set the priority field to 0 in the RP object . If the PCE does not take into account the request priority , it is RECOMMENDED to set the priority field to 0 in the RP object carried within the corresponding PCRep message , regardless of the priority value contained in the RP object carried within the corresponding PCReq message . A higher numerical value of the priority field reflects a higher priority . Note that it is the responsibility of the network administrator to make use of the priority values in a consistent manner across the various PCCs . The ability of a PCE to support request prioritization MAY be dynamically discovered by the PCCs by means of PCE capability discovery . If not advertised by the PCE , a PCC may decide to set the request priority and will learn the ability of the PCE to support request prioritization by observing the Priority field of the RP object received in the PCRep message . If the value of the Pri field is set to 0 , this means that the PCE does not support 	230	0

Also , for all TE LSPs except zero-bandwidth LSPs , when the R bit is set , the existing bandwidth of the TE LSP to be reoptimized MUST be supplied in a BANDWIDTH object ( see Section 7.7 ). This BANDWIDTH object is in addition to the instance of that object used to describe the desired bandwidth of the reoptimized LSP .

5555	H	After the mobile node detects movement , it configures a new care-of address . If the mobile node is in an IPv4-only network , it removes binding update list entries for correspondent nodes , since route optimisation cannot be supported . This may cause inbound packet losses , as remote correspondent nodes are unaware of such movement . To avoid confusion in the correspondent node , the mobile node SHOULD deregister its binding with each correspondent node by sending a deregistration binding update . The deregistration binding update message is tunnelled to the home agent and onto the correspondent node . This is done after the mobile node updates the home agent with its new location as discussed below . 	230	0

5760	NDB	Number of distribution buckets ( NDB ): 12 bits The number of distribution buckets of data . The size of each bucket can be calculated using the formula (( length * 4 ) - 12 ) * 8 / NDB number of bits . The calculation is based on the length of the whole sub-report block in octets ( length * 4 ) minus the header of 12 octets . Providing 12 bits for the NDB field enables bucket sizes as small as 2 bits for a full - length packet of MTU 1500 bytes . The bucket size in bits must always be divisible by 2 to ensure proper byte alignment . A bucket size of 2 bits is fairly restrictive , however , and it is expected that larger bucket sizes will be more practical for most distributions . 	400	0
5760	MF	Multiplicative Factor ( MF ): 4 bits 2^MF indicates the multiplicative factor to be applied to each distribution bucket value . Possible values of MF are 0 - 15 , creating a range of values from MF = 1 , 2 , 4 ... 32768 . Appendix B gives an example of the use of the multiplicative factor; it is meant to provide more " bits " without having them -- the bucket values get scaled up by the MF . 	240	0
5760	Length	Length : 8 bits The length field tells the receiver the full length of the sub - report block in 32-bit words ( i.e ., length * 4 bytes ) and enables the receiver to identify the bucket size . For example , given no MTU restrictions , the data portion of a distribution packet may be only as large as 1008 bytes ( 255 * 4 - 12 ), providing up to 4032 data buckets of length 2 bits , or 2016 data buckets of length 4 bits , etc . 	100	0

5760	Length	Length : 8 bits The length of the sub-report block in 32-bit words . For an IPv4 address , this should be 2 ( i.e ., total length = 4 + 4 = 2 * 4 octets ). For an IPv6 address , this should be 5 . For a DNS name , the length field indicates the number of 32-bit words making up the string plus 1 byte and any additional padding required to reach the next word boundary . 	100	0
5760	Port	Port : 2 octets The port number to which receivers send feedback reports . A port number of 0 is invalid and MUST NOT be used . 	400	0
5760	Address	Address : 4 octets ( IPv4 ), 16 octets ( IPv6 ), or n octets ( DNS name ) The address to which receivers send feedback reports . For IPv4 and IPv6 , fixed-length address fields are used . A DNS name is an arbitrary-length string that is padded with null bytes to the next 32-bit boundary . The string MAY contain Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications ( IDNA ) domain names and MUST be UTF-8 encoded [ 11 ]. 	230	0
5760	Collision SSRC	Collision SSRC : n * 32 bits This field contains a list of SSRCs that are duplicated within the group . Usually this is handled by the hosts upon detection of the same SSRC; however , since receivers in an SSM session using the Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model no longer have a global view of the session , the collision algorithm is handled by the Distribution Source . SSRCs that collide are listed in the packet . Each Collision SSRC is reported only once for each collision detection . If more Collision SSRCs need to be reported than fit into an MTU , the reporting is done in a round robin fashion so that all Collision SSRCs have been reported once before the second round of reporting starts . On receipt of the packet , receiver(s ) MUST detect the collision and select another SSRC , if the collision pertains to them . 	400	0
5760	SRBT	Collision detection is only possible at the Distribution Source . If the Distribution Source and Feedback Target functions are disjoint and collision reporting across RTP receiver SSRCs shall be provided , the Feedback Targets(s ) MUST forward the RTCP reports from the RTP receivers , including at least the RR and the SDES packets to the Distribution Source . 	301	0
5760	MFL	Median fraction lost ( MFL ): 8 bits The median fraction lost indicated by Receiver Reports forwarded to this Distribution Source , expressed as a fixed-point number with the binary point at the left edge of the field . A value of all ' 1's indicates that the MFL value is not provided . 	210	0
5760	HCNL	Highest cumulative number of packets lost ( HCNL ): 24 bits Highest ' cumulative number of packets lost ' value out of the most recent RTCP RR packets from any of the receivers . A value of all ' 1's indicates that the HCNL value is not provided . 	210	0
5760	SRBT	Note that , in case the Distribution Source and the Feedback Target functions are disjoint , it is only possible for the Distribution Source to determine the median of the inter-arrival jitter if all the Feedback Targets forward all RTCP reports from the receivers immediately and include at least the RR packet . 	201	0
5760	S	Sender ( S ): 1 bit The contained bandwidth value applies to each Media Sender . 	400	0

5820	N	o N : Incomplete bit . If NOT set , the complete state associated with the SCS number is included in the Hello packet . If set , this indicates that the appended TLVs are being sent ' persistently ', and that there is more state associated with the SCS number that was sent originally , but is not included in this Hello packet . This bit allows any desired TLVs to be sent ' persistently ' for a number of Hellos with the same SCS number without requiring all of the TLVs associated with that SCS number to be transmitted . The first time an SCS number is sent , the entire state associated with that SCS number is transmitted , and the N-bit MUST NOT be set . 	210	0

5820	LD Options	U-bit The " Unsynchronized " bit . This is set if the adjacency is being announced before databases are fully synchronized . 	301	0
5840	Next Header	Next Header , 8 bits : This field MUST be the same as the Next Header field in the ESP trailer when using ESP in the Integrity-only mode . When using ESP with encryption , the " Next Header " field looses this name and semantics and becomes an empty field that MUST be initialized to all zeros . The receiver MUST do some sanity checks before the WESP packet is accepted . The receiver MUST ensure that the Next Header field in the WESP header and the Next Header field in the ESP trailer match when using ESP in the Integrity-only mode . The packet MUST be dropped if the two do not match . Similarly , the receiver MUST ensure that the Next Header field in the WESP header is an empty field initialized to zero if using WESP with encryption . The WESP flags dictate if the packet is encrypted . 	231	0
5840	HdrLen	HdrLen , 8 bits : Offset from the beginning of the WESP header to the beginning of the Rest of Payload Data ( i.e ., past the IV , if present and any other WESP options defined in the future ) within the encapsulated ESP header , in octets . HdrLen MUST be set to zero when using ESP with encryption . When using integrity-only ESP , the following HdrLen values are invalid : any value less than 12; any value that is not a multiple of 4; any value that is not a multiple of 8 when using IPv6 . The receiver MUST ensure that this field matches with the header offset computed from using the negotiated Security Association ( SA ) and MUST drop the packet in case it does not match . 	110	0
5840	TrailerLen	TrailerLen , 8 bits : TrailerLen contains the size of the Integrity Check Value ( ICV ) being used by the negotiated algorithms within the IPsec SA , in octets . TrailerLen MUST be set to zero when using ESP with encryption . The receiver MUST only accept the packet if this field matches with the value computed from using the negotiated SA . This ensures that sender is not deliberately setting this value to obfuscate a part of the payload from examination by a trusted intermediary device . 	100	0
5840	Flags	Flags , 8 bits : The bits are defined most-significant-bit ( MSB ) first , so bit 0 is the most significant bit of the flags octet . 	231	0
5840	E	Encrypted Payload ( E ), 1 bit : Setting the Encrypted Payload bit to 1 indicates that the WESP ( and therefore ESP ) payload is protected with encryption . If this bit is set to 0 , then the payload is using integrity-only ESP . Setting or clearing this bit also impacts the value in the WESP Next Header field , as described above . The recipient MUST ensure consistency of this flag with the negotiated policy and MUST drop the incoming packet otherwise . 	210	0
5840	P	Padding header ( P ), 1 bit : If set ( value 1 ), the 4-octet padding is present . If not set ( value 0 ), the 4-octet padding is absent . This padding MUST be used with IPv6 in order to preserve IPv6 8-octet alignment . If WESP is being used with UDP encapsulation ( see Section 2.1 below ) and IPv6 , the Protocol Identifier ( 0x00000002 ) occupies 4 octets so the IPv6 padding is not needed , as the header is already on an 8-octet boundary . This padding MUST NOT be used with IPv4 , as it is not needed to guarantee 4-octet IPv4 alignment . 	210	0
5840	Rsvd	Rsvd , 4 bits : Reserved for future use . The reserved bits MUST be sent as 0 , and ignored by the receiver . Future documents defining any of these bits MUST NOT affect the distinction between encrypted and unencrypted packets or the semantics of HdrLen . In other words , even if new bits are defined , old implementations will be able to find the encapsulated packet correctly . Intermediate nodes dealing with unknown reserved bits are not necessarily able to parse the packet correctly . Intermediate treatment of such packets is policy dependent ( e.g ., it may dictate dropping such packets ). 	500	0

5845	Type	Type 	240	0
5845	Length	An 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length in octets of the option , excluding the Type and Length fields . If the Length field is set to 2 , it indicates that the GRE Key Identifier field is not being carried in the option .

5845	T	Otherwise , the TLV-header format ( T ) flag is cleared . The setting of the TLV-header Format ( T ) flag in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement indicates to the mobile access gateway that it MUST use the TLV - header UDP encapsulation format for all packets tunneled to the local mobility anchor for the entire duration the mobile node is attached to the mobile access gateway . The TLV-header UDP tunneling format SHOULD NOT change during a Binding Lifetime Extension Proxy Binding Update ( re-registration ) from the same mobile access gateway . 	302	0

5971	Message Routing Information	Message Routing Information ( MRI ): The set of data item values that is used to route a signalling message according to a particular MRM; for example , for routing along a flow path , the MRI includes flow source and destination addresses , and protocol and port numbers . See Section 3.3 . 	400	0
5971	D	Datagram mode ( D-mode ): used for small , infrequent messages with modest delay constraints and no security requirements . A special case of D-mode called Query-mode ( Q-mode ) is used when no routing state exists . 	400	0

5971	NSLPID	NSLP Identifier ( NSLPID ): This is an IANA-assigned identifier associated with the NSLP that is generating messages for this flow; see Section 3.8 . The inclusion of this identifier allows the routing state to be different for different NSLPs . 	231	0
5971	Q	Q-mode encapsulation : Where GIST is sending messages to be intercepted by the appropriate peer rather than directly addressed to it ( in particular , Query messages ), these are UDP encapsulated , and MAY include an IP Router Alert Option ( RAO ) if required by the MRM . Each GIST node can therefore see every such message , but unless the message exactly matches the Q-mode encapsulation rules ( Section 5.3.2 ) it MUST be forwarded transparently at the IP level . If it does match , GIST MUST check the NSLPID in the common header . The case where the NSLPID does not match a local signalling application at all is considered below in Section 4.3.4; otherwise , the message MUST be passed up to the GIST layer for further processing . 	400	0

5971	E	The rules governing the use of the R-flag depend on the GIST message type . It MUST always be set ( R=1 ) in Query messages , since these always elicit a Response , and never in Confirm , Data , or Error messages . It MAY be set in an MA-Hello; if set , another MA-Hello MUST be sent in reply . It MAY be set in a Response , but MUST be set if the Response contains a Responder-Cookie; if set , a Confirm MUST be sent in reply . The E-flag MUST NOT be set unless the message type is a Data message . 	210	0
5971	Type	Length ( 12 bits ): Length has the units of 32-bit words , and measures the length of Value . If there is no Value , Length=0 .

5974	R	REPLACE ( R ) - when set , the flag has two uses . First , it indicates that a RESERVE with different MRI ( but same SID ) replaces an existing one , so the old one MAY be torn down immediately . This is the default situation . This flag may be unset to indicate a desire from an upstream node to keep an existing reservation on an old branch in place . Second , this flag is also used to indicate whether the reserved resources on the old branch should be torn down or not when a data path change happens . In this case , the MRI is the same and only the route path changes . 	210	0

Flags MUST only be set if the data is present in the MRI ( i.e ., where there is a corresponding flag in the GIST MRI , the flag can only be set if the corresponding GIST MRI flag is set ). It should be noted that some flags in the PACKET-CLASSIFIER ( X and Y ) relate to data that is always present in the MRI , but are optional to use for QoS NSLP packet classification .

5977	2	Any signaling message could be delayed by an adversary . For example , if RESERVE ' messages are delayed over the duration of the refresh period , then the resource units ( bandwidth ) reserved along the nodes for corresponding sessions will be removed . In this situation , the Ingress node does not receive the RESPONSE within a certain period , and considers that the signaling message has failed , which may cause a retransmission of the " failed " message . The Egress node may distinguish between the two messages , i.e ., the delayed message and the retransmitted message , and it could get a proper response . 	302	0

6218	MAC Key ID	The MAC Key ID field is 16 octets in length and contains an identifier for the key . The combination of the MAC Key ID and the client and server IP addresses together uniquely identify a key shared between the RADIUS client and server . As a result , the MAC Key ID need not be globally unique . The MAC Key ID MUST refer to a key of a type and length appropriate for use with the algorithm specified by the MAC Type field ( see above ). 	231	0
6218	MAC	Both the length and value of the MAC field depend upon the algorithm specified by the value of the MAC Type field . If the algorithm specified is HMAC-SHA-1 , HMAC-SHA-256 , or HMAC-SHA-512 , the MAC field MUST be 20 , 32 , or 64 octets in length , respectively . If the algorithm specified is CMAC-AES-128 , CMAC-AES-192 , or CMAC-AES-256 , the MAC field SHOULD be 64 octets in length . The derivation of the MAC field value for all the algorithms specified in this document is identical , except for the algorithm used . There are differences , however , depending upon whether the MAC is being computed for a request message or a response . These differences are detailed below , with the free variable HASH-ALG representing the actual algorithm used . 	400	0

The exact meaning of these values is determined by the datum; the description in this section applies to the datums defined in this document . This document uses the same definition for all datums it specifies . 	231	0
6225	Latitude	In the DHCPv4 GeoConf Option 123 , the LaRes value encodes the number of high-order latitude bits that MUST be considered valid . Any bits entered to the right of this limit MUST NOT be considered valid and might be purposely false , or zeroed by the sender . The examples in Appendix B illustrate that a smaller value in the resolution field increases the area within which the device is located . A value of 2 in the LaRes field indicates a precision of no greater than 1/6th that of the globe ( see the first example of Appendix B ). A value of 34 in the LaRes field indicates a precision of about 3.11 mm in latitude at the equator . 	201	0

6274	Total Length	The Total Length field is the length of the datagram , measured in bytes , including both the IP header and the IP payload . Being a 16-bit field , it allows for datagrams of up to 65535 bytes . RFC 791 [ RFC0791 ] states that all hosts should be prepared to receive datagrams of up to 576 bytes ( whether they arrive as a whole , or in fragments ).

6275	Home Agent Preference	16-bit unsigned integer . The preference for the home agent sending this Router Advertisement , for use in ordering the addresses returned to a mobile node in the Home Agent Addresses field of a Home Agent Address Discovery Reply message . Higher values mean more preferable . If this option is not included in a Router Advertisement in which the Home Agent ( H ) bit is set , the preference value for this home agent MUST be considered to be 0 . Greater values indicate a more preferable home agent than lower values . 	231	0
6275	Home Agent Lifetime	16-bit unsigned integer . The lifetime associated with the home agent in units of seconds . The default value is the same as the Router Lifetime , as specified in the main body of the Router Advertisement . The maximum value corresponds to 18.2 hours . A 	100	0

6284	Associated Nonce	o Associated Nonce ( 64 bits ): Field that contains the nonce received in the Port Mapping Request message and used in Token construction . 	231	0
6284	Token Element	o Token Element ( variable size ): Element that is used to carry the Token generated by the server . This element is a 32-bit aligned Length-Value element . The Length field , which is 16 bits , indicates the length ( in octets ) of the Value field that follows the Length field . While a 16-bit length allows for Tokens with a size of up to 65535 bytes , using Tokens of sizes that make the RTCP compound packet larger than the MTU might have a negative impact on functionality because of IP fragmentation . Some NATs or other middleboxes do not pass IP fragments; thus , a large Token can cause the whole mechanism to fail . In addition , fragmentation increases the risk for packet loss . 	100	0
6284	Absolute Expiration Time	o Absolute Expiration Time ( 64 bits ): Field that contains the absolute expiration time of the Token . The absolute expiration time is expressed as a Network Time Protocol ( NTP ) timestamp value in seconds since the year 1900 [ RFC5905 ]. The client does not need to use this element directly and thus does not need to synchronize its clock with the server . However , the client needs to send this element back to the server along with the associated nonce in the Token Verification Request message and thus needs to keep it associated with the Token . 	121	0
6284	Relative Expiration Time	o Relative Expiration Time ( 32 bits ): Field that contains the relative expiration time of the Token . The relative expiration time is expressed in seconds from the time the Token was generated . Whenever a server decides to not grant a Token to a requesting client , the relative expiration time will be set to zero ( and hence , the accompanying Token will be invalid ). 	122	0
6284	Packet Types Element	o Packet Types Element ( variable size ): Element that is used to signal which RTCP packet types require Token-based authentication . This element is a 32-bit aligned Length-Value element . The Length field , which is 8 bits , indicates the length ( in octets ) of the Value field that follows the Length field . This length does not include any padding that is required for alignment . The Value field carries zero or more 8-bit sub-fields , each carrying an RTCP packet type . If the Packet Types element does not fall on a 	400	0

6284	SSRC of Packet Sender	o SSRC of Packet Sender : This is the server's SSRC , which equals the SSRC of the respective multicast stream . Note that this SSRC value is from a different SSRC space than the one used in the unicast session . 	231	0
6284	SSRC of Requesting Client	o SSRC of Requesting Client ( 32 bits ): Field that contains the SSRC of the client . 	400	0
6284	Failed PT	o Failed PT ( 8 bits ): Field that indicates the type of the RTCP packet that caused this failure message . 	231	0
6284	FMT	o FMT ( 5 bits ): Field that indicates the feedback message type ( FMT ) value of the RTCP packet that caused this failure . Together with the field above , the client can infer which RTCP message it had previously sent caused this failure message to be sent by the server . For example , if the client did not include a valid Token with an RTCP NACK message , the Failed PT field will indicate 205 ( RTPFB ) and the FMT field will indicate 1 ( Generic NACK ). If the RTCP message did not have an associated FMT value ( such as an RTCP BYE message ), the FMT field SHALL be set to zero . 	231	0
6284	Associated Nonce	o Associated Nonce ( 64 bits ): Field that contains the nonce received in the Token Verification Request message . If there was no Token Verification Request message included by the client , this field is set to zero . 	400	0
6285	Type	o Type : A single-octet identifier that defines the type of the parameter represented in this TLV element . 	231	0
6285	Length	o Length : A two-octet field that indicates the length ( in octets ) of the TLV element excluding the Type and Length fields and the 8-bit Reserved field between them . This length does not include any padding that is required for alignment . 	100	0
6285	Value	o Value : Variable-size set of octets that contains the specific value for the parameter . 	231	0
6285	Type	o Min RAMS Buffer Fill Requirement ( 32 bits ): Optional TLV element that denotes the minimum milliseconds of data that the RTP_Rx desires to have in its buffer before allowing the data to be consumed by the application . 	400	0
6285	Type	o Max RAMS Buffer Fill Requirement ( 32 bits ): Optional TLV element that denotes the maximum milliseconds of data that the RTP_Rx can buffer without losing the data due to buffer overflow . 	100	0
6285	Type	o Max Receive Bitrate ( 64 bits ): Optional TLV element that denotes the maximum bitrate ( in bits per second ) at which the RTP_Rx can process the aggregation of the unicast burst(s ) and any payload - specific information that will be provided by the BRS . The limits can include local receiver limits as well as network limits that are known to the receiver . 	231	0
6285	Type	o Preamble-only Allowed ( 0 bits ): Optional TLV element that indicates that the RTP_Rx is willing to receive only the preamble information for the desired primary multicast stream(s ) in case the BRS cannot send the unicast burst stream(s ). ( In such cases , the BRS will not accept the request , but will send a response code 511 in the RAMS-I message as defined in Section 11.6 .) Note that 	302	0
6285	Type	o Supported Enterprise Number(s ): Optional TLV element that indicates the enterprise number(s ) that the RTP_Rx implementation supports . Similar to the private extensions , the enterprise numbers here are as listed on http://www.iana.org . This TLV element , if exists , provides a hint to the BRS about which private extensions the RTP_Rx can potentially support . Note that an RTP_Rx does not necessarily support all the private extensions under a particular enterprise number . Unless the BRS explicitly knows which private extensions an RTP_Rx supports ( through this or some out-of-band means ), the BRS SHOULD NOT use private extensions in the RAMS-I messages . The BRS SHOULD rather use only vendor - neutral extensions . The Length field of this TLV element is set to 4*n , where n is the number of enterprise number entries . 	231	0
6285	Type	Type : 6 	240	0
6285	MSN	o Message Sequence Number ( MSN ) ( 8 bits ) : Mandatory field that denotes the sequence number of the RAMS-I message for the particular media sender SSRC specified in the message header . The MSN value SHALL be set to zero when a new RAMS request is received . During rapid acquisition , the same RAMS-I message MAY be repeated for redundancy purposes without incrementing the MSN value . If an updated RAMS-I message will be sent ( either with new information or updated information ), the MSN value SHALL be incremented by one . In the MSN field , the regular wrapping rules apply . Note that if the RTP_Rx has sent an updated request , it MUST check every RAMS-I message entirely , regardless of whether or not the MSN value has changed . 	200	0
6285	Response	o Response ( 16 bits ): Mandatory field that denotes the response code for this RAMS-I message . This document defines several initial response codes in Section 7.3.1 and registers them with IANA in Section 11.6 . If a new vendor-neutral response code will be defined , it MUST be registered with IANA through the guidelines specified in Section 11.6 . If the new response code is intended to be used privately by a vendor , there is no need for IANA management . Instead , the vendor MUST use the private extension mechanism ( Section 7.1.2 ) to convey its message and MUST indicate this by putting zero in the Response field . 	231	0
6285	Type	o RTP Seqnum of the First Packet ( 16 bits ): TLV element that specifies the RTP sequence number of the first packet that will be sent in the respective unicast RTP stream . This allows the RTP_Rx to know whether one or more packets sent by the BRS have been dropped at the beginning of the stream . If the BRS accepts the RAMS request , this element exists . If the BRS rejects the RAMS request , this element SHALL NOT exist . 	200	0
6285	Type	o Earliest Multicast Join Time ( 32 bits ): TLV element that specifies the delta time ( in ms ) between the arrival of the first RTP packet in the unicast RTP stream ( which could be a burst packet or a payload-specific packet ) and the earliest time instant when an RTP_Rx MAY send an SFGMP Join message to join the multicast session . A zero value indicated in this element means that the RTP_Rx MAY send the SFGMP Join message right away . If the RTP_Rx does not want to wait until the earliest multicast join time , it MAY send a RAMS-T message , and after a reasonable amount of time , it MAY join the SSM session . 	122	0
6285	Type	o Burst Duration ( 32 bits ): Optional TLV element that denotes the time the burst will last ( in ms ), i.e ., the difference between the expected transmission times of the first and the last burst packets that the BRS is planning to send in the respective unicast RTP stream . In the absence of additional stimulus , the BRS will 	122	0

6306	A	When the initiator and responder reside in different ALOC realms , the A-bit is set to 1 and the Area and Endpoint Locator fields must be used in the locator header . The size of the locator header is 12 bytes . When the A-bit is set to 0 , the initiator and responder reside within the same ALOC realm . The Area and Endpoint Locator shall not be used in the locator header . The size of the locator header is 4 bytes . 	400	0
6306	I	The identifier bit is set to 1 if the endpoint is using an identifier/locator split scheme within the locator header . The identifier/locator split scheme must indicate by how much the size of the locator header is increased . The Locator Header Length field is also added to the locator header . 	210	0
6306	S	The initiator sets the swap bit to 0 in the hIPv4 packet . An RBR will set this bit to 1 when it is swapping the source and destination addresses of the IP header with the ALOC and ELOC prefixes of the locator header . 	210	0
6306	FI	The purpose of the Forwarding Indicator ( FI ) field is to provide a mechanism for a future forwarding plane to identify which Forwarding Information Base ( FIB ) should be used for inter-ALOC realm sessions . The new forwarding plane will remove the swap functionality of IP and locator header values for both unicast and multicast sessions . The outcome is that the IP and transport protocol headers will remain intact and only FI and LH checksum values in the locator header will alternate . The following values are defined : 	400	0

6306	Padding	The locator header padding is used to ensure that the locator header ends on a 32-bit boundary . The padding is zero . 	302	0
6306	S	To enable RPF globally for an ( S,G ), the multicast-enabled RBR ( mRBR ) must at the source's ALOC realm replace the value of the source address field in the IP header with the local ALOC prefix for inter - ALOC multicast streams . This can be achieved if the local RBR acts also as an anycast Rendezvous Point with MSDP and PIM capabilities . With these functionalities the RBR becomes a multicast-enabled RBR ( mRBR ). The source registers at the mRBR and a source tree is established between the source and the mRBR . When an inter-ALOC realm receiver subscribes to the multicast group , the mRBR has to swap the hIPv4 header in the following way : 	230	0

6311	Incoming IPsec SA delta value	o Incoming IPsec SA delta value ( 4 or 8 octets ): The sender requests that the peer should increment all the Child SA replay counters for the sender's incoming ( the peer's outgoing ) traffic by this value . The size of this field depends on the ESN bit associated with the Child SAs : if the ESN bit is 1 , the field's size is 8 octets; otherwise , it is 4 octets . We note that this constrains the Child SAs of each IKE SA to either all have the ESN bit on or off . 	302	0

6325	V	Version ( V ) is a 2-bit field . Version zero of TRILL is specified in this document . An RBridge RB1 MUST check the V field in a received TRILL-encapsulated frame . If the V field has a value not recognized by RB1 , then RB1 MUST silently discard the frame . The allocation of new TRILL Version numbers requires an IETF Standards Action . 	302	0
6325	V	Version ( V ) is a 2-bit field . Version zero of TRILL is specified in this document . An RBridge RB1 MUST check the V field in a received TRILL-encapsulated frame .

6325	R	The two R bits are reserved for future use in extensions to this version zero of the TRILL protocol . They MUST be set to zero when the TRILL header is added by an ingress RBridge , transparently copied but otherwise ignored by transit RBridges , and ignored by egress RBridges . The allocation of reserved TRILL header bits requires an IETF Standards Action . 	500	0
6325	M	The Multi-destination bit ( see Section 2.4.2 ) indicates that the frame is to be delivered to a class of destination end stations via a distribution tree and that the egress RBridge nickname field specifies this tree . In particular : 	231	0

6325	Egress RBridge Nickname	There are two cases for the contents of the egress RBridge nickname field , depending on the M bit ( see Section 3.4 ). The nickname is filled in by the ingress RBridge for TRILL Data frames and by the source RBridge for TRILL ESADI frames . 	231	0
6325	Ingress RBridge Nickname	The ingress RBridge nickname is set to a nickname of the ingress RBridge for TRILL Data frames and to a nickname of the source RBridge for TRILL ESADI frames . If the RBridge setting the ingress nickname has multiple nicknames , it SHOULD use the same nickname in the ingress field whenever it encapsulates a frame with any particular Inner.MacSA and Inner.VLAN value . This simplifies end node learning . 	231	0
6325	TRILL Header	o TRILL Header : Egress Nickname and Ingress Nickname . These specify nicknames of the egress and ingress RBridges , respectively , unless the frame is multi-destination , in which case the Egress Nickname specifies the distribution tree on which the frame is being sent . 	231	0
6325	Inner Ethernet Header	o Inner Ethernet Header : Inner Destination MAC Address ( Inner.MacDA ) and Inner Source MAC Address ( Inner.MacSA ): These addresses are as transmitted by the original end station , specifying , respectively , the destination and source of the inner frame . 	230	0
6325	Frame Check Sequence	Each Ethernet frame has a single Frame Check Sequence ( FCS ) that is computed to cover the entire frame , for detecting frame corruption due to bit errors on a link . Thus , when a frame is encapsulated , the original FCS is not included but is discarded . Any received frame for which the FCS check fails SHOULD be discarded ( this may not be possible in the case of cut through forwarding ). The FCS normally changes on encapsulation , decapsulation , and every TRILL hop due to changes in the outer destination and source addresses , the decrementing of the hop count , etc . 	301	0

6550	Flags	Flags : The 5 bits remaining unused in the Flags field are reserved for flags . The field MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver . 	500	0
6550	Version Number	Version Number : 8-bit unsigned integer containing the value of DODAGVersionNumber that is being solicited when valid . 	220	0
6550	RPLInstanceID	RPLInstanceID : 8-bit unsigned integer containing the RPLInstanceID that is being solicited when valid . 	400	0
6550	DODAGID	DODAGID : 128-bit unsigned integer containing the DODAGID that is being solicited when valid . 	400	0
6550	Option Type	Option Length : 30 . Note that this length is expressed in units of single octets , unlike in IPv6 ND . 	100	0
6550	Option Length	Option Length : 30 . Note that this length is expressed in units of single octets , unlike in IPv6 ND . 	100	0
6550	Prefix Length	Prefix Length : 8-bit unsigned integer . The number of leading bits in the Prefix field that are valid . The value ranges from 0 to 128 . The Prefix Length field provides necessary information for on-link determination ( when combined with the ' L ' flag in the PIO ). It also assists with address autoconfiguration as specified in [ RFC4862 ], for which there may be more restrictions on the prefix length . 	100	0
6550	L	L : 1-bit on-link flag . When set , it indicates that this prefix can be used for on-link determination . When not set , the advertisement makes no statement about on-link or off-link properties of the prefix . In other words , if the ' L ' flag is not set , a RPL node MUST NOT conclude that an address derived from the prefix is off-link . That is , it MUST NOT update a previous indication that the address is on-link . A RPL node acting as a router MUST NOT propagate a PIO with the ' L ' flag set . A RPL node acting as a router MAY propagate a PIO with the ' L ' flag not set . 	210	0
6550	A	A : 1-bit autonomous address-configuration flag . When set , it indicates that this prefix can be used for stateless address configuration as specified in [ RFC4862 ]. When both protocols ( ND RAs and RPL DIOs ) are used to carry PIOs on the same link , it is possible to use either one for SLAAC by a RPL node . It is also possible to make either protocol ineligible for SLAAC operation by forcing the ' A ' flag to 0 for PIOs carried in that protocol . 	210	0
6550	R	R : 1-bit router address flag . When set , it indicates that the Prefix field contains a complete IPv6 address assigned to the sending router that can be used as parent in a target option . The indicated prefix is the first prefix length bits of the Prefix field . The router IPv6 address has the same scope and conforms to the same lifetime values as the advertised prefix . This use of the Prefix field is compatible with its use in advertising the prefix itself , since Prefix Advertisement uses only the leading bits . Interpretation of this flag bit is thus independent of the processing required for the on-link ( L ) and autonomous address-configuration ( A ) flag bits . 	230	0
6550	Reserved	Reserved1 : 5-bit unused field . It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver . 	500	0
6550	Valid Lifetime	Valid Lifetime : 32-bit unsigned integer . The length of time in seconds ( relative to the time the packet is sent ) that the prefix is valid for the purpose of on-link determination . A value of all one bits ( 0xFFFFFFFF ) represents infinity . The Valid Lifetime is also used by [ RFC4862 ]. 	120	0
6550	Preferred Lifetime	Preferred Lifetime : 32-bit unsigned integer . The length of time in seconds ( relative to the time the packet is sent ) that addresses generated from the prefix via stateless address autoconfiguration remain preferred [ RFC4862 ]. A value of all one bits ( 0xFFFFFFFF ) represents infinity . See [ RFC4862 ]. Note that the value of this field MUST NOT exceed the Valid Lifetime field to avoid preferring addresses that are no longer valid . 	100	0
6550	Reserved	Reserved2 : This field is unused . It MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver . 	500	0
6550	Prefix	Prefix : An IPv6 address or a prefix of an IPv6 address . The Prefix Length field contains the number of valid leading bits in the prefix . The bits in the prefix after the prefix length are reserved and MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver . A router SHOULD NOT send a prefix option for the link-local prefix , and a host SHOULD ignore such a prefix option . A non-storing node SHOULD refrain from advertising a prefix till it owns an address of that prefix , and then it SHOULD advertise its full address in this field , with the ' R ' flag set . The children of a node that so advertises a full address with the ' R ' flag set may then use that address to determine the content of the DODAG Parent Address subfield of the Transit Information option . 	230	0

6550	DAOSequence	DAOSequence : This sequence counter is present in the DAO Base to correlate a DAO message and a DAO ACK message . The DAOSequence number is locally significant to the node that issues a DAO message for its own consumption to detect the loss of a DAO message and enable retries . 	400	0
6550	Path Sequence	Path Sequence : This sequence counter is present in the Transit Information option in a DAO message . The purpose of this counter is to differentiate a movement where a newer route supersedes a stale one from a route redundancy scenario where multiple routes exist in parallel for the same target . The Path Sequence is globally significant in a DODAG and indicates the freshness of the route to the associated target . An older ( lesser ) value received from an originating router indicates that the originating router holds stale routing states and the originating router should not be considered anymore as a potential next hop for the target . The Path Sequence is computed by the node that advertises the target , that is the Target itself or a router that advertises a Target on behalf of a host , and is unchanged as the DAO content is propagated towards the root by parent routers . If a host does not pass a counter to its router , then the router is in charge of computing the Path Sequence on behalf of the host and the host can only register to one router for that purpose . If a DAO message containing the same Target is issued to multiple parents at a given point in time for the purpose of route redundancy , then the Path Sequence is the same in all the DAO messages for that same target . 	301	0
6550	DODAGID	DODAGID : The DODAGID is a Global or Unique Local IPv6 address of the root . A node that joins a DODAG SHOULD provision a host route via a DODAG parent to the address used by the root as the DODAGID . 	230	0
6550	Rank	1 . A node MUST NOT advertise a Rank less than or equal to any member of its parent set within the DODAG Version . 	231	0
6550	Path Control	A DAO message from a node contains one or more Target options . Each Target option specifies either a prefix advertised by the node , a prefix of addresses reachable outside the LLN , the address of a destination in the node's sub-DODAG , or a multicast group to which a node in the sub-DODAG is listening . The Path Control field of the Transit Information option allows nodes to request or allow for multiple Downward routes . A node constructs the Path Control field of a Transit Information option as follows : 	230	0

6551	I	o I ( Included ): the ' I ' bit is only relevant when the node type is used as a constraint . For example , the path must only traverse mains-powered nodes . Conversely , battery-operated nodes must be excluded . The ' I ' bit is used to stipulate inclusion versus exclusion . When set , this indicates that nodes of the type specified in the node type field MUST be included . Conversely , when cleared , this indicates that nodes of type specified in the node type field MUST be excluded . 	210	0
6551	T	o T ( node Type ): 2-bit field indicating the node type . T=0 designates a mains-powered node , T=1 a battery-powered node , and T=2 a node powered by an energy scavenger . 	240	0
6551	E	o E ( Estimation ): when the ' E ' bit is set for a metric , the estimated percentage of remaining energy on the node is indicated in the E_E 8-bit field . When cleared , the estimated percentage of remaining energy is not provided . When the ' E ' bit is set for a constraint , the E_E field defines a threshold for the inclusion/ exclusion : if an inclusion , nodes with values higher than the threshold are to be included; if an exclusion , nodes with values lower than the threshold are to be excluded . 	210	0
6551	E_E	E_E ( Estimated-Energy ): 8-bit unsigned integer field indicating an estimated percentage of remaining energy . The E_E field is only relevant when the ' E ' flag is set , and it MUST be set to 0 when the ' E ' flag is cleared . 	210	0
6551	Throughput	Many LLNs support a wide range of throughputs . For some links , this may be due to variable coding . For the deeply duty-cycled links found in many LLNs , the variability comes as a result of trading power consumption for bit rate . There are several MAC layer protocols that allow for the effective bit rate of a link to vary over more than three orders of magnitude with a corresponding change in power consumption . For efficient operation , it may be desirable for nodes to report the range of throughput that their links can handle in addition to the currently available throughput . 	231	0
6551	Throughput	Throughput : 32 bits . The Throughput is encoded in 32 bits in unsigned integer format , expressed in bytes per second . 	400	0
6551	Latency	Similar to throughput , the latency of many LLN MAC sub-layers can vary over many orders of magnitude , again with a corresponding change in power consumption . Some LLN MAC link layers will allow the latency to be adjusted globally on the subnet , on a link-by-link basis , or not at all . Some will insist that it be fixed for a given link , but allow it to be variable from link to link . 	231	0
6551	Latency	Latency : 32 bits . The Latency is encoded in 32 bits in unsigned integer format , expressed in microseconds . 	110	0
6551	Val	Val : LQL value from 0 to 7 where 0 means undetermined and 1 indicates the highest link quality . 	302	0
6551	Counter	Counter : number of links with that value . 	303	0
6551	ETX	ETX : 16 bits . The ETX * 128 is encoded using 16 bits in unsigned integer format , rounded off to the nearest whole number . For example , if ETX = 3.569 , the object value will be 457 . If ETX > 511.9921875 , the object value will be the maximum , which is 65535 . 	200	0

6559	Reserved	Reserved : Set to zero on transmission and ignored on receipt . 	500	0
6559	Holdtime	Holdtime : This specifies a Holdtime in seconds for the connection . A non-zero value means that the connection SHOULD be gracefully shut down if no further PORT messages are received within the specified time .

At least one ( ITR-RLOC-AFI , ITR-RLOC-Address ) pair MUST be encoded . Multiple ' ITR-RLOC Address ' fields are used , so a Map-Replier can select which destination address to use for a Map-Reply . The IRC value ranges from 0 to 31 . For a value of 0 , there is 1 ITR-RLOC address encoded; for a value of 1 , there are 2 ITR-RLOC addresses encoded , and so on up to 31 , which encodes a total of 32 ITR-RLOC addresses . 	301	0

6830	ACT	ACT : This 3-bit field describes Negative Map-Reply actions . In any other message type , these bits are set to 0 and ignored on receipt . These bits are used only when the ' Locator Count ' field is set to 0 . The action bits are encoded only in Map-Reply messages . The actions defined are used by an ITR or PITR when a destination EID matches a negative Map-Cache entry . Unassigned values should cause a Map-Cache entry to be created , and when packets match this negative cache entry , they will be dropped . The current assigned values are : 	210	0
6830	A	A : The Authoritative bit , when sent , is always set to 1 by an ETR . When a Map-Server is proxy Map-Replying [ RFC6833 ] for a LISP site , the Authoritative bit is set to 0 . This indicates to requesting ITRs that the Map-Reply was not originated by a LISP node managed at the site that owns the EID-Prefix . 	210	0
6830	Priority	Priority : Each RLOC is assigned a unicast Priority . Lower values are more preferable . When multiple RLOCs have the same Priority , they MAY be used in a load-split fashion . A value of 255 means the RLOC MUST NOT be used for unicast forwarding . 	231	0
6830	Weight	Weight : When priorities are the same for multiple RLOCs , the Weight indicates how to balance unicast traffic between them . Weight is encoded as a relative weight of total unicast packets that match the mapping entry . For example , if there are 4 Locators in a Locator-Set , where the Weights assigned are 30 , 20 , 20 , and 10 , the first Locator will get 37.5% of the traffic , the 2nd and 3rd Locators will get 25% of the traffic , and the 4th Locator will get 12.5% of the traffic . If all Weights for a Locator-Set are equal , the receiver of the Map-Reply will decide how to load-split the traffic . See Section 6.5 for a suggested hash algorithm to distribute the load across Locators with the same Priority and equal Weight values . 	301	0
6830	M Priority	M Priority : Each RLOC is assigned a multicast Priority used by an ETR in a receiver multicast site to select an ITR in a source multicast site for building multicast distribution trees . A value of 255 means the RLOC MUST NOT be used for joining a multicast distribution tree . For more details , see [ RFC6831 ]. 	400	0
6830	M Weight	M Weight : When priorities are the same for multiple RLOCs , the Weight indicates how to balance building multicast distribution trees across multiple ITRs . The Weight is encoded as a relative weight ( similar to the unicast Weights ) of the total number of trees built to the source site identified by the EID-Prefix . If all Weights for a Locator-Set are equal , the receiver of the Map-Reply will decide how to distribute multicast state across ITRs . For more details , see [ RFC6831 ]. 	231	0
6830	Unused Flags	Unused Flags : These are set to 0 when sending and ignored on receipt . 	500	0
6830	L	L : When this bit is set , the Locator is flagged as a local Locator to the ETR that is sending the Map-Reply . When a Map-Server is doing proxy Map-Replying [ RFC6833 ] for a LISP site , the L-bit is set to 0 for all Locators in this Locator-Set . 	210	0
6830	p	p : When this bit is set , an ETR informs the RLOC-Probing ITR that the locator address for which this bit is set is the one being RLOC-probed and MAY be different from the source address of the Map-Reply . An ITR that RLOC-probes a particular Locator MUST use this Locator for retrieving the data structure used to store the fact that the Locator is reachable . The p-bit is set for a single Locator in the same Locator-Set . If an implementation sets more than one p-bit erroneously , the receiver of the Map-Reply MUST select the first Locator . The p-bit MUST NOT be set for Locator-Set records sent in Map-Request and Map-Register messages . 	210	0
6830	R	R : This is set when the sender of a Map-Reply has a route to the Locator in the Locator data record . This receiver may find this useful to know if the Locator is up but not necessarily reachable from the receiver's point of view . See also Section 6.4 for another way the R-bit may be used . 	201	0
6830	Locator	Locator : This is an IPv4 or IPv6 address ( as encoded by the ' Loc-AFI ' field ) assigned to an ETR . Note that the destination RLOC address MAY be an anycast address . A source RLOC can be an anycast address as well . The source or destination RLOC MUST NOT be the broadcast address ( 255.255.255.255 or any subnet broadcast address known to the router ) and MUST NOT be a link-local multicast address . The source RLOC MUST NOT be a multicast address . The destination RLOC SHOULD be a multicast address if it is being mapped from a multicast destination EID . 	230	0
6830	Type	Type : 3 ( Map-Register ) 	231	0
6830	P	P : This is the proxy Map-Reply bit . When set to 1 , an ETR sends a Map-Register message requesting the Map-Server to proxy a Map-Reply . The Map-Server will send non-authoritative Map-Replies on behalf of the ETR . Details on this usage can be found in [ RFC6833 ]. 	210	0
6830	Reserved	Reserved : This field MUST be set to 0 on transmit and MUST be ignored on receipt . 	500	0
6830	M	M : This is the want-map-notify bit . When set to 1 , an ETR is requesting a Map-Notify message to be returned in response to sending a Map-Register message . The Map-Notify message sent by a Map-Server is used to acknowledge receipt of a Map-Register message . 	210	0
6830	Record Count	Record Count : This is the number of records in this Map-Register message . A record is comprised of that portion of the packet labeled ' Record ' above and occurs the number of times equal to Record Count . 	231	0
6830	Nonce	Nonce : This 8-octet ' Nonce ' field is set to 0 in Map-Register messages . Since the Map-Register message is authenticated , the ' Nonce ' field is not currently used for any security function but may be in the future as part of an anti-replay solution . 	500	0
6830	Key ID	Key ID : This is a configured ID to find the configured Message Authentication Code ( MAC ) algorithm and key value used for the authentication function . See Section 14.4 for codepoint assignments . 	230	0
6830	Authentication Data Length	Authentication Data Length : This is the length in octets of the ' Authentication Data ' field that follows this field . The length of the ' Authentication Data ' field is dependent on the MAC algorithm used . The length field allows a device that doesn't know the MAC algorithm to correctly parse the packet . 	100	0
6830	Authentication Data	Authentication Data : This is the message digest used from the output of the MAC algorithm . The entire Map-Register payload is authenticated with this field preset to 0 . After the MAC is computed , it is placed in this field . Implementations of this specification MUST include support for HMAC-SHA-1-96 [ RFC2404 ], and support for HMAC-SHA-256-128 [ RFC4868 ] is RECOMMENDED . 	400	0

6830	IH	IH : The inner IPv4 or IPv6 header , which can use either RLOC or EID addresses in the header address fields . When a Map-Request is encapsulated in this packet format , the destination address in this header is an EID . 	230	0
6830	LCM	LCM : The format is one of the control message formats described in this section . At this time , only Map-Request messages are allowed to be encapsulated . In the future , PIM Join/Prune messages [ RFC6831 ] might be allowed . Encapsulating other types of LISP control messages is for further study . When Map-Requests are sent for RLOC-Probing purposes ( i.e ., the probe-bit is set ), they MUST NOT be sent inside Encapsulated Control Messages . 	301	0

6849	PT	Payload Type ( PT ): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is either specified by the RTP profile under which this payload format is used or more likely signaled dynamically out-of-band ( e.g ., using SDP; Section 7.1.3 defines the name binding ). 	400	0
6849	M	Marker ( M ) bit : If the received RTP packet is looped back in multiple encapsulating RTP packets , the M bit is set to 1 in every fragment except the last packet; otherwise , it is set to 0 . 	210	0
6849	F	Possible values are First Fragment ( 00 ), Last Fragment ( 01 ), No Fragmentation ( 10 ), or Intermediate Fragment ( 11 ). This field identifies how much of the received packet is encapsulated in this packet by the loopback mirror . If the received packet is not fragmented , this field is set to 10; otherwise , the packet that contains the first fragments sets this field to 00 . The packet that contains the last fragment sets this field to 01 , and all other packets set this field to 11 . 	240	0
6849	PT	Payload Type ( PT ): The assignment of an RTP payload type for the encapsulating packet format is outside the scope of this document; it is either specified by the RTP profile under which this payload format is used or more likely signaled dynamically out-of-band ( e.g ., using SDP; Section 7.2.3 defines the name binding ). 	400	0
6849	M	Marker ( M ) bit : This bit is set to the value in the received packet . 	210	0
6865	m	m defines the length of the elements in the finite field , in bits . In this document , m is such that 2 <= m <= 16 . 	100	0
6865	S	o Strict ( S ) flag : when set to 1 , this flag indicates that the E parameter is the actual encoding symbol length value for each block of the session ( unless otherwise notified by an updated FFCI if this possibility is considered by the use case or CDP ). When set to 0 , this flag indicates that the E parameter is the maximum encoding symbol length value for each block of the session ( unless otherwise notified by an updated FFCI if this possibility is considered by the use case or CDP ). 	210	0
6865	m	o m parameter ( m ): an integer that defines the length of the elements in the finite field , in bits . We have : 2 <= m <= 16 . 	100	0

6865	m	o Encoding Symbol ID ( ESI ) ( m-bit field ): this field identifies the repair symbol contained in this FEC repair packet . This value is such that k <= ESI <= n - 1 for repair symbols . 	231	0
6865	S	o Strict ( S ) flag : flipping this S flag from 0 to 1 ( i.e ., E is now considered as a strict value ) enables an attacker to mislead the receiver if the actual symbol size varies over different source blocks . Flipping this S flag from 1 to 0 has no major consequences unless the receiver requires to have a fixed E value ( e.g ., because the receiver pre-allocates memory space ). 	210	0
6876	Reserved	Reserved for future use . This field MUST be set to 0 on transmission and ignored upon reception . 	500	0
6876	Message Type Vendor ID	This field indicates the owner of the namespace associated with the message type . This is accomplished by specifying the 24-bit Structure of Management Information ( SMI ) Private Enterprise Number [ PEN ] ( Vendor ID ) of the party who owns the message type namespace . Consistent with PA-TNC and PB-TNC , we depend on the PEN fitting in 24 bits , so if IANA were to register a wider PEN , then that PEN could not be used with NEA . IETF namespace PT-TLS Message Types MUST use zero ( 0 ) in this field . For more information about the intended use of NEA namespace identifiers , see the PA-TNC specification ( RFC 5792 ), Sections 2.1 and 2.2 . 	400	0
6876	Message Type	This field defines the type of the PT-TLS message within the scope of the specified Message Type Vendor ID that is included in the Message Value field . The specific IETF-defined values allowable in this field when the Message Type Vendor ID is the IETF SMI Private Enterprise Number value ( 0 ) are defined in Section 3.6 .

6998	A	o Accumulate Route ( A ): A value of 1 in this flag indicates that the Measurement Request is accumulating a Source Route for use by the End Point to send the Measurement Reply back to the Start Point . Route accumulation MUST NOT be used ( i.e ., this flag MUST NOT be set to one ) inside a Measurement Request , unless it travels along a Hop-by-hop Route represented by a local RPLInstanceID ( i.e ., H = 1 and RPLInstanceID has a local value ). Route accumulation MAY be used ( i.e ., this flag MAY be set to one ) if the Measurement Request is traveling along a Hop-by-hop Route with a local RPLInstanceID .

This flag MAY be set to one inside a Measurement Request only if a Source Route , from the Start Point to the End Point , is being measured . Otherwise , this flag MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on reception . 	210	0
6998	B	o Back Request ( B ): A value of 1 in this flag serves as a request to the End Point to send a Measurement Request towards the Start Point . On receiving a Measurement Request with the B flag set to one , the End Point SHOULD generate a Measurement Request to measure the cost of its current ( or the most preferred ) route to the Start Point . Receipt of this Measurement Request would allow the Start Point to know the cost of the back route from the End Point to itself and thus determine the round-trip cost of reaching the End Point . 	302	0
6998	I	o Intermediate Reply ( I ): A value of 1 in this flag serves as permission to an Intermediate Point to generate a Measurement Reply if it knows the aggregated values of the routing metrics being measured for the rest of the route . Setting this flag to one may be useful in scenarios where the Hop Count [ RFC6551 ] is the routing metric of interest and an Intermediate Point ( e.g ., the root of a non-storing global DAG or a common ancestor of the Start Point and the End Point in a storing global DAG ) may know the Hop Count of the remainder of the route to the End Point . This flag MAY be set to one only if a Hop-by-hop Route with a global RPLInstanceID is being measured ( i.e ., H = 1 and RPLInstanceID has a global value ). Otherwise , this flag MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on reception . 	302	0

7174	OAM Message Channel	The OAM Message Channel provides methods to communicate OAM-specific details between RBridges . CFM [ 802.1Q ] and [ RFC4379 ] have implemented OAM message channels . It is desirable to select an appropriate technology and reuse it , instead of redesigning yet another OAM channel . TRILL is a transport layer that carries Ethernet frames , so the TRILL OAM model specified earlier is based on the CFM [ 802.1Q ] model . The use of the CFM [ 802.1Q ] encoding format for the OAM Message Channel is one possible choice . [ TRILL-OAM ] presents a proposal on the use of CFM [ 802.1Q ] payload as the OAM Message Channel . 	400	0

7266	CHID	If multiple channels of audio are carried in one RTP stream , each channel of audio will be viewed as an independent channel ( e.g ., left channel audio , right channel audio ). This field is used to identify each channel carried in the same media stream . The default channel mapping follows static ordering rule described in Section 4.1 of [ RFC3551 ]. However , there are some payload formats that use different channel mappings , e.g ., AC-3 audio over RTP [ RFC4184 ] only follow AC-3 channel order scheme defined in [ ATSC ]. Enhanced AC-3 audio over RTP [ RFC4598 ] uses a dynamic channel transform mechanism . In order for the appropriate channel mapping to be determined , MOS metrics reports need to be tied to an RTP payload format . The reports should include the payload type of the reported media according to [ RFC6792 ], so that it can be used to determine the appropriate channel mapping . 	400	0

7272	PT	Payload Type ( PT ): 7 bits . This field identifies the format of the media payload , according to [ RFC3551 ]. This is the payload type of the RTP packet reported upon . The PT field is needed in the case where the MSAS is neither the media server nor a receiver of the media stream , i.e ., it is implemented as a third-party entity . In such cases , the MSAS needs the PT to determine the rate of advancement of the timestamps of the RTP media stream to be able to relate reports from different SCs on different RTP timestamp values . 	400	0
7272	Resrv	Reserved bits ( Resrv ): 25 bits . These bits are reserved for future use and SHALL be set to 0 at transmission and MUST be ignored by the receiver . 	500	0

7272	Packet Received RTP timestamp	Packet Received RTP timestamp : 32 bits . This timestamp has the value of the RTP timestamp carried in the RTP header [ RFC3550 ] of the RTP packet to which the XR IDMS relates . Several consecutive RTP packets will have equal timestamps if they are ( logically ) generated at once , e.g ., belong to the same video frame .

7272	Packet Presented NTP timestamp	Packet Presented NTP timestamp : 32 bits . This timestamp reflects the wallclock time at the moment the rendered media unit ( e.g ., video frame or audio sample ) contained in the first byte of the associated RTP packet is presented to the user . It is based on the time format used by NTP and consists of the least significant 16 bits of the NTP seconds part and the most significant 16 bits of the NTP fractional second part . If no Packet Presented NTP timestamp is available , this field SHALL be set to 0 and be considered empty , and the Packet Presented NTP timestamp flag ( P ) SHALL be set to 0 .

Presented in this context means the moment the data is played out to the user of the system , i.e ., sound played out through speakers , video images being displayed on some display , etc . The accuracy resulting from the synchronization algorithm will only be as good as the accuracy with which the SCs can determine the delay between receiving packets and presenting them to the end user . If no presentation timestamps are reported by SCs , the ability to accurately synchronize playout may be limited . 	121	0

This field provides a " chaining " capability whereby additional payloads can be added to a message by appending each one to the end of the message and setting the Next Payload field of the preceding payload to indicate the new payload's type . An Encrypted payload , which must always be the last payload of a message , is an exception . It contains data structures in the format of additional payloads . In the header of an Encrypted payload , the Next Payload field is set to the payload type of the first contained payload ( instead of 0); conversely , the Next Payload field of the last contained payload is set to zero . The payload type values are listed here . The values in the following table are only current as of the publication date of RFC 4306 .

For IPv6 UDP encapsulation , the IPv6 header does not include a checksum , so this field MUST contain a UDP checksum that MUST be used as specified in [ RFC768 ] and [ RFC2460 ] unless one of the exceptions that allows use of UDP zero-checksum mode ( as specified in [ RFC6935 ]) applies . See Section 3.1 for specification of these exceptions and additional requirements that apply when UDP zero-checksum mode is used for MPLS-in-UDP traffic over IPv6 . 	301	0

7514	Checksum	The checksum is the 16-bit ones's complement of the one's complement sum of the ICMP message starting with the ICMP type field . When an RECN message is encapsulated in an IPv6 packet , the computation includes a " pseudo-header " of IPv6 header fields as specified in Section 8.1 of [ RFC2460 ]. For computing the checksum , the checksum field is first set to zero . 	301	0
7514	Explicit Notification	A 4-byte value that conveys an explicit notification in the ASCII format defined in [ RFC20 ]. This field MUST NOT be set to zero . 	302	0
7553	Priority	This field holds the priority of the target URI in this RR . Its range is 0-65535 . A client MUST attempt to contact the URI with the lowest-numbered priority it can reach; URIs with the same priority SHOULD be selected according to probabilities defined by the weight field . 	230	0
7553	Weight	This field holds the server selection mechanism . The weight field specifies a relative weight for entries with the same priority . Larger weights SHOULD be given a proportionately higher probability of being selected . The range of this number is 0-65535 . 	231	0
7553	Target	This field holds the URI of the target , enclosed in double-quote characters ('"'), where the URI is as specified in RFC 3986 [ RFC3986 ]. Resolution of the URI is according to the definitions for the Scheme of the URI . 	230	0
7553	Priority	The remaining data in the RDATA contains the Target field . The Target field contains the URI as a sequence of octets ( without the enclosing double-quote characters used in the presentation format ). 	400	0
7555	Address Type	The type and length of the address found in the in the Destination IP Address and Next Hop IP Addresses fields . The values are shared with the Downstream Mapping Address Type Registry . 	231	0
7555	Reply Mode	The reply mode to be sent in the MPLS Echo Request message; the values are as specified in [ RFC4379 ]. 	301	0
7555	Proxy Flags	The Proxy Request Initiator sets zero , one , or more of these flags to request actions at the Proxy LSR . 	302	0
7555	TTL	The TTL to be used in the label stack entry corresponding to the topmost FEC in the MPLS Echo Request packet . Valid values are in the range [ 1,255 ]. 	120	0
7555	Source UDP Port	Source UDP Port 	302	0
7555	Global Flags	Global Flags 	302	0
7555	MPLS Payload Size	Used to request that the MPLS payload ( IP header + UDP header + MPLS Echo Request ) be padded using a zero-filled Pad TLV so that the IP header , UDP header , and MPLS Echo Request total the specified size . Having the field set to zero means no size request is being made . If the requested size is less than the minimum size required to form the MPLS Echo Request , the request will be treated as a best-effort request with the Proxy LSR building the smallest possible packet ( i.e ., not using a Pad TLV ). The IP header DF bit MUST be set when this field is non-zero . 	400	0
7555	Destination IP Address	If the Address Type is IPv4 , an address from the range 127/8; if the Address Type is IPv6 , an address from the range :: ffff:7f00:0/104 	230	0

7555	Proxy Flags	IANA has created and maintains a new registry for the Proxy Flags that are used with the Proxy Echo Parameters TLV . See Section 5.1 for details . The registry is in the " Multi-Protocol Label Switching ( MPLS ) Label Switched Paths ( LSPs ) Ping Parameters " registry in the " Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture ( MPLS )" name space . The registration procedure is Standards Action [ RFC5226 ]. The initial values are as follows . 	231	0

7563	Format	Format : This specifies the encoding format of the civic location . The value 0 is defined in this specification as described below . The remaining values ( 1 through 255 ) are reserved . 	303	0
7563	Reserved	Reserved : This MUST be set to zero when sending and ignored when received . 	500	0
7563	civic location	civic location : This field will contain the civic location . The format ( encoding ) type is specified in the format field of this sub-option . Note that the length SHALL NOT exceed 253 bytes . 	400	0

7570	Reserved	Reserved : Reserved MUST be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted in the ERO , MUST NOT be changed when a node processes the ERO , and MUST be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding ERO subobjects . 	500	0
7570	R	R : This bit reflects the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and LSP_ATTRIBUTE semantic defined in [ RFC5420 ]. When set , it indicates required hop attributes to be processed by the node . When cleared , it indicates that the hop attributes are not required as described in Section 2.3 . 	210	0
7570	Reserved	Reserved : Reserved MUST be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted in the RRO , MUST NOT be changed when a node processes the RRO , and MUST be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding RRO subobjects . 	500	0
7574	HANDSHAKE	For Peer P to establish communication with Peer Q in Swarm S , the peers must first exchange HANDSHAKE messages by means of a handshake procedure . The initiating Peer P needs to know the metadata of Swarm S , which consists of : 	400	0
7574	HAVE	The HAVE message is used to convey which chunks a peer has available for download . The set of chunks it has available may be expressed using different chunk addressing and availability map compression schemes , described in Section 4 . HAVE messages can be used both for sending a complete overview of a peer's chunk availability as well as for updates to that set . 	400	0
7574	DATA	The DATA message is used to transfer chunks of content . The DATA message MUST contain the chunk ID of the chunk and chunk itself . A peer MAY send the DATA messages for multiple chunks in the same datagram . The DATA message MAY contain additional information if needed by the specific congestion control mechanism used . At present , PPSPP uses LEDBAT [ RFC6817 ] for congestion control , which requires the current system time to be sent along with the DATA message , so the current system time MUST be included . 	301	0
7574	ACK	ACK messages MUST be sent to acknowledge received chunks if PPSPP is run over an unreliable transport protocol . ACK messages MAY be sent if a reliable transport protocol is used . In the former case , a receiving peer that has successfully checked the integrity of a chunk , or interval of chunks C , MUST send an ACK message containing a chunk specification for C . As LEDBAT is used , an ACK message MUST contain the one-way delay , computed from the peer's current system time received in the DATA message . A peer MAY delay sending ACK messages as defined in the LEDBAT specification [ RFC6817 ]. 	303	0
7574	REQUEST	While bulk download protocols normally do explicit requests for certain ranges of data ( i.e ., use a pull model , for example , BitTorrent [ BITTORRENT ]), live streaming protocols quite often use a push model without requests to save round trips . PPSPP supports both models of operation . 	400	0
7574	PEX_REQ	Peer Exchange ( PEX ) messages are common in many peer-to-peer protocols . They allow peers to exchange the transport addresses of the peers they are currently interacting with , thereby reducing the need to contact a central tracker ( or Distributed Hash Table ) to discovery new peers . The strength of this mechanism is therefore that it enables decentralized peer discovery : after an initial bootstrap , a central tracker is no longer needed . Its weakness is that it enables a number of attacks , so it should not be used on the Internet unless extra security measures are in place . 	231	0
7574	Protocol Options	The HANDSHAKE message in PPSPP can contain the following protocol options . Unless stated otherwise , a protocol option consists of an 8-bit code followed by an 8-bit value . Larger values are all encoded 	231	0
7574	Version	A peer MUST include the maximum version of the PPSPP it supports as the first protocol option in the list . The code for this option is 0 . Defined values are listed in Table 3 . 	220	0
7574	Chunk Size	A peer in a swarm MUST include the chunk size the swarm uses . The code for this option is 9 . Its value is a 32-bit integer denoting the size of the chunks in bytes in big-endian format . When variable chunk sizes are used , this option MUST be set to the special value 0xFFFFFFFF . Section 8.1 explains how content publishers can determine a value for this option . 	100	0
7574	Chunk Size	In general , a UDP datagram containing PPSPP messages SHOULD fit inside a single IP packet , so its maximum size depends on the MTU of the network . If the UDP datagram does not fit , its chance of getting lost in the network increases as the loss of a single fragment of the datagram causes the loss of the complete datagram . 	400	0
7574	HANDSHAKE	A channel is established with a handshake . To start a handshake , the initiating peer needs to know the swarm metadata , defined in Section 3.1 and the IP address and UDP port of a peer . A datagram containing a HANDSHAKE message then looks as follows : 	400	0
7574	Protocol Options	Protocol Options : A list of protocol options encoding the swarm's metadata , as defined in Section 7 . 	400	0
7574	HAVE	A HAVE message ( type 0x03 ) consists of a single chunk specification that states that the sending peer has those chunks and successfully checked their integrity . The single chunk specification represents a consecutive range of verified chunks . A bin consists of a single integer , and a chunk or byte range of two integers , of the width specified by the Chunk Addressing protocol options , encoded big - endian . 	400	0
7574	DATA	A DATA message ( type 0x01 ) consists of a chunk specification , a timestamp , and the actual chunk . In case a datagram contains one DATA message , a sender MUST always put the DATA message in the tail of the datagram . A datagram MAY contain multiple DATA messages when the chunk size is fixed and when none of the DATA messages carry the last chunk , if that is smaller than the chunk size . As LEDBAT congestion control is used , a sender MUST include a timestamp , in 	400	0
7574	ACK	An ACK message ( type 0x02 ) acknowledges data that was received from its addressee; to comply with the LEDBAT delay-based congestion control , an ACK message consists of a chunk specification and a timestamp representing a one-way delay sample . The one-way delay sample is a 64-bit integer with microsecond accuracy , and it is computed from the timestamp received from the previous DATA message containing the chunk being acknowledged following the LEDBAT specification . 	301	0
7574	REQUEST	A REQUEST message ( type 0x08 ) consists of a chunk specification for the chunks the requester wants to download . 	400	0
7574	PEX_REQ	A PEX_REQ ( 0x06 ) message has no payload . A PEX_RESv4 ( 0x05 ) message consists of an IPv4 address in big-endian format followed by a UDP port number in big-endian format . A PEX_RESv6 ( 0x0c ) message contains a 128-bit IPv6 address instead of an IPv4 one . If a PEX_REQ message does not originate from a private , unique-local , link-local , or multicast address [ RFC1918 ] [ RFC4193 ] [ RFC4291 ], then the PEX_RES* messages sent in reply MUST NOT contain such addresses . This is to prevent leaking of internal addresses to external peers . 	400	0
7574	Version	Version : 1 	220	0
7574	Chunk Size	The receiving peer MAY respond , in which case the returned datagram MUST consist of the channel ID from the sender's HANDSHAKE message ( 0x00000001 ); a HANDSHAKE message , whose payload is a locally unused; a random channel ID ( 0x00000008 ); and a list of protocol options; followed by any other messages it wants to send . 	303	0
7574	HANDSHAKE	o Secured against DoS Amplification attacks as described in Section 12.1 . 	400	0
7574	HAVE	o Threat HAVE.1 : Malicious Peer T can claim to have content that it does not . Subsequently , Peer T won't respond to requests . 	302	0

7574	ACK	12.6.4 . ACK 	240	0
7574	REQUEST	o Threat REQUEST.1 : Peer T could request lots from Peer A , leaving Peer A without resources for others . 	240	0
7579	Encoding	This section provides encodings for the information elements defined in [ RFC7446 ] that have applicability to WSON . The encodings are designed to be suitable for use in the GMPLS routing protocols OSPF [ RFC4203 ] and IS-IS [ RFC5307 ] and in the PCE Communication Protocol ( PCEP ) [ RFC5440 ]. Note that the information distributed in [ RFC4203 ] and [ RFC5307 ] is arranged via the nesting of sub-TLVs within TLVs; this document defines elements to be used within such constructs . Specific constructs of sub-TLVs and the nesting of sub-TLVs of the information element defined by this document will be defined in the respective protocol enhancement documents . 	400	0

7579	Link Set Field	We will frequently need to describe properties of groups of links . To do so efficiently , we can make use of a link set concept similar to the label set concept of [ RFC3471 ]. The Link Set Field is used in the < ConnectivityMatrix >, which is defined in Section 2.1 . The information carried in a link set is defined as follows : 	400	0

7579	PRI	PRI ( Priority Flags , 8 bits ): A bitmap used to indicate which priorities are being advertised . The bitmap is in ascending order , with the leftmost bit representing priority level 0 ( i.e ., the highest ) and the rightmost bit representing priority level 7 ( i.e ., the lowest ). A bit MUST be set ( 1 ) corresponding to each priority represented in the sub-TLV and MUST NOT be set ( 0 ) when the corresponding priority is not represented . If a label is available at priority M , it MUST be advertised available at each priority N < M . At least one priority level MUST be advertised . 	231	0

If a label is available at priority M , it MUST be advertised available at each priority N < M . At least one priority level MUST be advertised . 	231	0
7579	Label Set Field	The Label Set Field is used within the Available Labels Field or the Shared Backup Labels Field , defined in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 , respectively . It is also used within SIMPLE_LABEL , LABEL_RANGE , or SIMPLE_LABEL & CHANNEL_COUNT , defined in Sections 2.2.1 , 2.2.3 , and 2.2.4 , respectively . 	400	0
7579	4	Num Labels is generally the number of labels . It has a specific meaning depending on the Action value . See Sections 2.6.1 , 2.6.2 , and 2.6.3 for details . Num Labels is a 12-bit integer . 	231	0
7579	Link Set Field	Suppose that we wish to describe a set of input ports that have link local identifiers numbered 3 through 42 . In the Link Set Field , we set Action = 1 to denote an inclusive range , Dir = 1 to denote input links , and Format = 0 to denote link local identifiers . Thus , we have : 	240	0
7579	Label Set Field	In this example , we use a 40-channel C-Band Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing ( DWDM ) system with 100 GHz spacing with lowest frequency 192.0 THz ( 1561.4 nm ) and highest frequency 195.9 THz ( 1530.3 nm ). These frequencies correspond to n = - 11 and n = 28 , respectively . Now suppose the following channels are available : 	400	0
7581	Action	Action : 8 bits 	400	0
7581	0	Indicates that the TLV contains one or more RB elements that are included in the list . 	231	0
7581	1	Indicates that the TLV contains one or more ranges of RBs . Each individual range is denoted by two 32-bit RB identifiers . The first 32 bits is the RB identifier for the start of the range , and the next 32 bits is the RB identifier for the end of the range . Note that the Length field is used to determine the number of ranges . 	240	0

The mobile node identifies the label for each of the interfaces through which it registers a CoA with the home agent . When using static traffic flow policies on the mobile node and the home agent , the label can be used for indexing forwarding policies . For example , the operator may have a policy that binds an IP flow " F1 " to any interface with the label " Blue ". When a registration through an interface matching the label " Blue " gets activated , the home agent and the mobile node establish an IP tunnel and the tunnel is marked with that label . Both the home agent and the mobile node generate traffic rules for forwarding IP flow traffic " F1 " through the mobile IP tunnel matching the label " Blue ".

Both of these extensions are non-skippable extensions to the Mobile IPv4 header in accordance to the long extension format of [ RFC5944 ]. Both of these extensions use a common Type value , Multipath-Extension ( 154 ), but are identified using different Subtype values . The Type value 154 for these extensions has been allocated from the " Extensions to Mobile IP Registration Messages " registry at the URL < http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobileip-numbers >. The field " Permitted for Notification Messages " for this extension MUST be set to " N ". 	400	0

7728	PauseID	All messages defined in this specification ( Section 8 ) contain a PauseID , satisfying the design consideration on sequence numbering ( Section 4.7 ). This PauseID is scoped by and thus a property of the targeted RTP stream ( SSRC ) and is not only a sequence number for individual messages . Instead , it numbers an entire " pause and resume operation " for the RTP stream , typically keeping PauseID constant for multiple , related messages . The PauseID value used during such operation is called the current PauseID . A new " pause and resume operation " is defined to start when the RTP stream sender resumes the RTP stream after it was being paused . The current PauseID is then incremented by one in modulo arithmetic . In the subsequent descriptions below , it is sometimes necessary to refer to PauseID values that were already used as the current PauseID , which is denoted as the past PauseID . It should be noted that since PauseID uses modulo arithmetic , a past PauseID may have a larger value than the current PauseID . Since PauseID uses modulo arithmetic , it is also useful to define what PauseID values are considered " past " to clearly separate it from what could be considered " future " PauseID values . Half of the entire PauseID value range is chosen to represent a past PauseID , while a quarter of the PauseID value range is chosen to represent future values . The remaining quarter of the PauseID value range is intentionally left undefined in that respect . 	400	0

7741	M	M : The most significant bit of the first octet is an extension flag . If M is set , the remainder of the PictureID field MUST contain 15 bits , else it MUST contain 7 bits . Note : this M bit is not to be confused with the M bit in the RTP header . 	210	0
7741	PictureID	PictureID : 7 or 15 bits ( shown left and right , respectively , in Figure 2 ) not including the M bit . This is a running index of the frames , which MAY start at a random value , MUST increase by 1 for each subsequent frame , and MUST wrap to 0 after reaching the maximum ID ( all bits set ). The 7 or 15 bits of the PictureID go from most significant to least significant , beginning with the first bit after the M bit . The sender chooses a 7 - or 15-bit index and sets the M bit accordingly . The receiver MUST NOT assume that the number of bits in PictureID stays the same through the session . Having sent a 7-bit PictureID with all bits set to 1 , the sender may either wrap the PictureID to 0 or extend to 15 bits and continue incrementing . 	201	0
7741	TL0PICIDX	TL0PICIDX : 8 bits temporal level zero index . TL0PICIDX is a running index for the temporal base layer frames , i.e ., the frames with TID set to 0 .

The index MAY start at a random value , and it MUST wrap to 0 after reaching the maximum number 255 . Use of TL0PICIDX depends on the presence of TID . Therefore , it is RECOMMENDED that the TID be used whenever TL0PICIDX is . 	400	0

Additionally , the Y bit MUST be set to 0 if any frame following the current frame depends on a non - base-layer frame older than the base-layer frame with TL0PICIDX equal to that of the current frame . If the Y bit is set when the T bit is equal to 0 , the current frame MUST only depend on a past base-layer ( TID=0 ) key frame as signaled by a change in the KEYIDX field . Additionally , this frame MUST NOT depend on any of the three codec buffers ( as defined by [ RFC6386 ]) that have been updated since the last time the KEYIDX field was changed . 	210	0
7741	KEYIDX	KEYIDX : 5 bits temporal key frame index . The KEYIDX field MUST be ignored by the receiver when the K bit is set equal to 0 . The KEYIDX field is a running index for key frames . KEYIDX MAY start at a random value , and it MUST wrap to 0 after reaching the maximum number 31 . When in use , the KEYIDX SHOULD be present for both key frames and interframes . The sender MUST increment KEYIDX for key frames that convey parameter updates critical to the interpretation of subsequent frames , and it SHOULD leave the KEYIDX unchanged for key frames that do not contain these critical updates . If the KEYIDX is present , a receiver SHOULD NOT decode an interframe if it has not received and decoded a key frame with the same KEYIDX after the last KEYIDX wraparound . 	201	0

7845	Pre-skip	There is some amount of latency introduced during the decoding process , to allow for overlap in the CELT mode , stereo mixing in the SILK mode , and resampling . The encoder might have introduced additional latency through its own resampling and analysis ( though the exact amount is not specified ). Therefore , the first few samples produced by the decoder do not correspond to real input audio , but are instead composed of padding inserted by the encoder to compensate for this latency . These samples need to be stored and decoded , as Opus is an asymptotically convergent predictive codec , meaning the decoded contents of each frame depend on the recent history of decoder inputs . However , a player will want to skip these samples after decoding them . 	231	0
7845	Pre-skip	This is the number of samples ( at 48 kHz ) to discard from the decoder output when starting playback , and also the number to subtract from a page's granule position to calculate its PCM sample position . When cropping the beginning of existing Ogg Opus streams , a pre-skip of at least 3,840 samples ( 80 ms ) is RECOMMENDED to ensure complete convergence in the decoder . 	200	0

8046	Locator	This document defines a generalization of an address called a " locator ". A locator specifies a point of attachment to the network but may also include additional end-to-end tunneling or a per-host demultiplexing context that affects how packets are handled below the logical HIP sublayer of the stack . This generalization is useful because IP addresses alone may not be sufficient to describe how packets should be handled below HIP . For example , in a host multihoming context , certain IP addresses may need to be associated with certain ESP SPIs to avoid violating the ESP anti-replay window . Addresses may also be affiliated with transport ports in certain tunneling scenarios . Locators may simply be traditional network addresses . The format of the Locator fields in the LOCATOR_SET parameter is defined in Section 4 . 	230	0

8060	Instance ID	Instance ID : the low-order 24 bits that can go into a LISP data header when the I bit is set . See [ RFC6830 ] for details . The reason for the length difference is so that the maximum number of instances supported per mapping system is 2^32 , while conserving space in the LISP data header . This comes at the expense of limiting the maximum number of instances per xTR to 2^24 . If an xTR is configured with multiple Instance IDs where the value in the high-order 8 bits is the same , then the low-order 24 bits MUST be unique . 	400	0

8231	A	A ( Administrative - 1 bit ): On PCRpt messages , the A flag indicates the PCC's target operational status for this LSP . On PCUpd messages , the A flag indicates the LSP status that the PCE desires for this LSP . In both cases , a value of ' 1 ' means that the desired operational state is active , and a value of ' 0 ' means that the desired operational state is inactive . A PCC ignores the A flag on a PCUpd message unless the operator's policy allows the PCE to control the corresponding LSP's administrative state . 	210	0

8260	Message Identifier	Message Identifier ( MID ): 32 bits ( unsigned integer ) The MID is the same for all fragments of a user message; it is used to determine which fragments ( enumerated by the FSN ) belong to the same user message . For ordered user messages , the MID is also used by the SCTP receiver to deliver the user messages in the correct order to the upper layer ( similar to the SSN of the DATA chunk defined in [ RFC4960 ]). The sender uses two counters for each outgoing stream : one for ordered messages and one for unordered messages . All of these counters are independent and initially 0 . They are incremented by 1 for each user message . Please note that the serial number arithmetic defined in [ RFC1982 ] using SERIAL_BITS = 32 applies . Therefore , the sender MUST NOT have more than 2**31 - 1 ordered messages for each outgoing stream in flight and MUST NOT have more than 2**31 - 1 unordered messages for each outgoing stream in flight . A message is considered in flight if at least one of its I-DATA chunks is not acknowledged in a way that cannot be reneged ( i.e ., not acknowledged by the cumulative TSN Ack ). Please note that the MID is in " network byte order ", a.k.a . Big Endian . 	230	0
8260	Payload Protocol Identifier	Payload Protocol Identifier ( PPID ) / Fragment Sequence Number ( FSN ): 32 bits ( unsigned integer ) If the B bit is set , this field contains the PPID of the user message . Note that in this case , this field is not touched by an SCTP implementation; therefore , its byte order is not necessarily in network byte order . The upper layer is responsible for any byte order conversions to this field , similar to the PPID of DATA chunks . In this case , the FSN is implicitly considered to be 0 . If the B bit is not set , this field contains the FSN . The FSN is used to enumerate all fragments of a single user message , starting from 0 and incremented by 1 . The last fragment of a message MUST have the E bit set . Note that the FSN MAY wrap completely multiple times , thus allowing arbitrarily large user messages . For the FSN , the serial number arithmetic defined in [ RFC1982 ] applies with SERIAL_BITS = 32 . Therefore , a sender MUST NOT have more than 2**31 - 1 fragments of a single user message in flight . A fragment is considered in flight if it is not acknowledged in a way that cannot be reneged . Please note that the FSN is in " network byte order ", a.k.a . Big Endian . 	400	0
8260	New Cumulative TSN	New Cumulative TSN : 32 bits ( unsigned integer ) This indicates the New Cumulative TSN to the data receiver . Same as the New Cumulative TSN for FORWARD TSN chunks , as specified in [ RFC3758 ]. 	231	0

The initial TTL value SHOULD be configurable via the control plane; the configured initial value can be specific to one or more SFPs . If no initial value is explicitly provided , the default initial TTL value of 63 MUST be used . Each SFF involved in forwarding an NSH packet MUST decrement the TTL value by 1 prior to NSH forwarding lookup . Decrementing by 1 from an incoming value of 0 shall result in a TTL value of 63 .

The initial Classifier for a given SFP SHOULD set the SI to 255; however , the control plane MAY configure the initial value of the SI as appropriate ( i.e ., taking into account the length of the SFP ). The Service Index MUST be decremented by a value of 1 by Service Functions or by SFC Proxy nodes after performing required services; the new decremented SI value MUST be used in the egress packet's NSH . The initial Classifier MUST send the packet to the first SFF in the identified SFP for forwarding along an SFP . If re-classification occurs , and that re-classification results in a new SPI , the ( re-)Classifier is , in effect , the initial Classifier for the resultant SPI . 	231	0
8300	Metadata Class	Metadata Class ( MD Class ): Defines the scope of the Type field to provide a hierarchical namespace . Section 9.1.4 defines how the MD Class values can be allocated to standards bodies , vendors , and others . 	231	0

The receiver MUST round the Length field up to the nearest 4-byte-word boundary , to locate and process the next field in the packet . The receiver MUST access only those bytes in the metadata indicated by the Length field ( i.e ., actual number of bytes ) and MUST ignore the remaining bytes up to the nearest 4-byte-word boundary . The length may be 0 or greater . 	100	0
8300	Service Path Identifier	Metadata information may influence the service path selection since the Service Path Identifier values can represent the result of classification . A given SPI can be defined based on classification results ( including metadata classification ). The imposition of the SPI and SI results in the packet being placed on the newly specified SFP at the position indicated by the imposed SPI and SI . 	231	0
